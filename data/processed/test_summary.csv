We are also planning to make the road a state highway and will send a proposal to the government. This is because the volume of traffic has remained the same despite the road being denotified as a highway,? he said.The proposed flyover, spanning 538 metres, is pegged at Rs50 crore and its design was changed from combined six-lane to three-lane (each side) split-type one. The middle portion between the two lanes will be used for the RRTS, which will come up on an elevated section, like the metro train system.The authority had proposed the flyover to decongest the city roads as a heavy volume of traffic is witnessed at the intersection.?The design for the flyover has been approved by the RRTS agency. The flyover design report is waiting to be vetted by IIT, Roorkee. The UP state bridge corporation is the construction agency. Once the design is vetted, the flyover construction can be started.

Why must we? Because not only does cotton keep one cool in the summer, it also gives a big boost to Indian handloom and livelihood to weavers.So, we give you four solid reasons to ditch all other fabrics in the cruel Indian summer and wear cotton everyday:1. It keeps you cool in summers and warm in winters: Basically, cotton provides thermal insulation because the fabric traps air between fibres. Cotton fibres also keep the fabric away from the skin, letting even more air pass through, which helps with insulation."

"President Ram Nath Kovind on Tuesday said in a speech that ""nation building requires national pride"", adding ""each citizen of India is a nation builder"". He talked about the various professionals of India, and how they act as nation builders. He also said that India has believed in the philosophy of ""Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam - the World is My Family"". ","Ram Nath Kovind was sworn in as the 14th President of India in the Central Hall of Parliament on Tuesday. The following is the full text of the speech delivered by him.""Respected Shri Pranab Mukherjee ji,Shri Hamid Ansari ji,Shri Narendra Modi ji,Shrimati Sumitra Mahajan ji,Shri Justice J. S. Khehar ji,Excellencies,Honourable Members of Parliament,Ladies and Gentlemen, andFellow CitizensI thank you for electing me to the responsibility of the President of India, and I enter this office with all humility. Coming here to Central Hall has brought back so many memories. I have been a Member of Parliament and here, in this very Central Hall, have had discussions with many of you. Often we agreed, sometimes we disagreed. But we learnt to respect each other. And that is the beauty of democracy.I grew up in a mud house, in a small village. My journey has been a long one, and yet this journey is hardly mine alone. It is so telling of our nation and our society also. For all its problems, it follows that basic mantra given to us in the Preamble to the Constitution - of ensuring Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity and I will always continue to follow this basic mantra.I bow to the 125 crore citizens of this great nation and promise to stay true to the trust they have bestowed on me. I am conscious I am following in the footsteps of stalwarts such as Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, and my immediate predecessor, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, whom we address out of affection as Pranab Da.Our Independence was the result of efforts by thousands of patriotic freedom fighters led by Mahatma Gandhi. Later, Sardar Patel integrated our nation. Principal architect of our Constitution Babasaheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar instilled in us the value of human dignity and of the republican ethic.These leaders did not believe that simply political freedom was enough. For them, it was crucial to also achieve economic and social freedom for millions of our people.We would be completing 70 years of our Independence soon. We are also well into the second decade of the 21st century, a century that so many of us intuitively believe will be an Indian century, guided and shaped by India and its accomplishments. We need to build an India that is an economic leader as well as a moral exemplar. For us, those two touchstones can never be separate. They are and must forever be linked.The key to India's success is its diversity. Our diversity is the core that makes us so unique. In this land we find a mix of states and regions, religions, languages, cultures, lifestyles and much more. We are so different and yet so similar and united.The India of the 21st century will be one that is in conformity with our ancient values as well as compliant with the Fourth Industrial Revolution. There is no dichotomy there, no question of choice. We must combine tradition and technology, the wisdom of an age-old Bharat and the science of a contemporary India.As the gram panchayat must determine our consultative and community based problem solving, the Digital Republic must help us leapfrog developmental milestones. These are the twin pillars of our national endeavour.Nations are not built by governments alone. The government can at best be a facilitator, and a trigger for society's innate entrepreneurial and creative instincts. Nation building requires national pride:- We take pride in the soil and water of India;- We take pride in the diversity, religious harmony and inclusive ethos of India;- We take pride in the culture, heritage and spirituality of India;- We take pride in our fellow citizens;- We take pride in our work; and- We take pride in the little things we do every day.Each citizen of India is a nation builder. Each one of us is a custodian of India's well-being and of the legacy that we will pass on to coming generations.- The armed forces that protect our borders and keep us safe are nation builders.- Those police and paramilitary forces that fight terrorism and crime are nation builders.- That farmer toiling in the blazing sun to feed fellow citizens is a nation builder. And we must never forget that so much of our farm labour comprises  women.- That scientist concentrating tirelessly and 24 x 7 to send an Indian space mission to Mars, or invent a vaccine, is a nation builder.- That nurse or doctor helping the sick to recover and fighting disease in a remote village, is a nation builder.- That young person who founds a start-up and becomes a job creator is a nation builder. The start-up could be on a small farm, converting mangoes to pickles. Or in an artisans' village, weaving carpets. Or at a laboratory lit up by giant screens.- That tribal and ordinary citizen striving to preserve our ecology, our forests, our wildlife, to push back climate change and to advance the cause of renewable energy, is a nation builder.- That committed and driven public servant who works beyond the call of duty, whether on a flooded road, directing traffic; or in a quiet room, poring over detailed files, is a nation builder.- That self-less teacher who equips young children and shapes their destinies, is a nation builder.- Those countless women who take care of families with so many other responsibilities, at home and work, and raise children to become ideal citizens, are nation builders.People elect their representatives from the Gram Panchayat to Parliament. They vest their will and hopes in these representatives. In turn, the people's representatives devote their lives to the service of nation.But, our endeavours are not for ourselves alone. Down the ages, India has believed in the philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam - the World is My Family. It is appropriate that the land of Lord Buddha should lead the world in its search for peace, tranquility and ecological balance.India's voice counts in today's world. The entire planet is drawn to Indian culture and soft power. The global community looks to us for solutions to international problems - whether terrorism, money laundering or climate change. In a globalised world, our responsibilities are also global.This links us to our global family, our friends and partners abroad, and our diaspora, that contributes in so many ways across the world. It brings us to the support of other nations, whether by extending the umbrella of the International Solar Alliance or being first respondents following natural disasters.We have achieved a lot as a nation, but the effort to do more, to do better and to do faster should be relentless. This is especially so as we approach the 75th Year of our independence in 2022. What must also bother us is our ability to enhance access and opportunity for the last person and the last girl-child from an under-privileged family if I may put it so, in the last house in the last village. This must include a quick and affordable justice delivery system in all judicial forums.The citizens of this country are the real source of strength to me.I am confident that they will continue to give me the energy to serve the nation.We need to sculpt a robust, high growth economy, an educated, ethical and shared community, and an egalitarian society, as envisioned by Mahatma Gandhi and Deen Dayal Upadhyay ji. These are integral to our sense of humanism. This is the India of our dreams, an India that will provide equality of opportunities. This will be the India of the 21st century.Thank you very much!Jai HindVande Mataram"" Also Read:Ram Nath Kovind sworn in as India's 14th President; accept role with humility, he saysAll you need to know about Ram Nath Kovind, 14th President of India15 initiatives President Pranab Mukherjee will always be remembered forRam Nath Kovind set to enter Rashtrapati Bhavan: All about 340-room Raisina Hill palaceBJP's presidential candidate Ram Nath Kovind: An ardent dog lover"

The second photograph shows the judge hiding  below the dais and passing some orders by banging the gavel on the table."" With this, the court felt that ""prima facie, though the above referred photographs do indicate total disrespect or disregard to the high office of this court, we cannot jump to that conclusion unless the contexts in which these scenes are shown, are examined in their proper perspective"".Thus, the court felt that it is necessary to appoint a committee as amicus curiae to watch the film and submit a report."

The New York Times told the Politico news site in a statement: ?We have asked the White House to clarify the tweet.?US media suggested that Trump may have been referring to a Fox News report about comments made by a top general at a security conference on Friday in Aspen, Colorado.At that gathering, General Tony Thomas -- head of the US military?s Special Operations Command -- reportedly said that American forces at one point came ?particularly close? to Baghdadi after a 2015 raid recovered information about the Islamic State group.Fox News reported that Thomas said US troops had ?a very good lead,? on the IS leader?s whereabouts. ?Unfortunately, it was leaked in a prominent national newspaper about a week later and that lead went dead,? Thomas reportedly said at the forum.US Secretary of Defence James Mattis said Friday that he believes Baghdadi is still alive, following various claims in recent months that he has been killed.?We are going after him, but we assume he is alive,? the Pentagon chief said.There have been persistent rumors that Baghdadi has died in recent months.With a $25 million US bounty on his head, Baghdadi has kept a low profile but is rumored to move regularly throughout IS-held territory in Iraq and Syria.The Iraqi -- nicknamed ?The Ghost? -- has not been seen since making his only known public appearance as ?caliph? in 2014 at the Grand Mosque of Al-Nuri in Mosul, which was destroyed in the battle for Iraq?s second city.The Times has become a favorite Trump target despite his penchant for reaching out to the daily, including this week, when he gave its reporters a major interview in which he criticized his own Attorney General Jeff Sessions.In Saturday?s tweetstorm, Trump railed against The Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for its ?illegal leaks.??A new INTELLIGENCE LEAK from the Amazon Washington Post, this time against A.G. Jeff Sessions,? he wrote on Twitter, adding ?These illegal leaks... must stop!?He also groused about some of his favorite targets: the failure of US lawmakers to repeal ?dead? Obamacare, Democratic ?obstructionists? and alleged ?ties to Russia? by Hillary Clinton, his defeated opponent in last year?s presidential election."
"DIG Roopa, who submitted a report alleging VK Sasikala being given VIP treatment in jail, has been issued a notice asking her to publish an apology in leading newspapers. The notice has been served by transferred Karnataka DGP HN Satyanarayana Rao, who was blamed in the report for taking bribe to give Sasikala special treatment in jail.","Former Karnataka deputy inspector general of prisons Roopa D Moudgil, who alleged that AIADMK leader VK Sasikala received preferential treatment in Bengaluru Central Prison by paying a bribe, has been issued a legal notice by former director general of police (prisons) HN Sathyanarayana Rao seeking unconditional apology for saying there were allegations of bribery against him.In her controversial report, Moudgil had said she heard allegations Sasikala paid a bribe of Rs 2 crore to senior prison officials, including Rao, for getting privileged treatment, which, among other things, including a private kitchen.Moudgil was transferred to the position of inspector general of police and commissioner for traffic and road safety, Bengaluru. Rao was also transferred, but without charge as he is set to retire at the end of the month.In a notice dated July 16 and released by his lawyers, Rao has denied all the allegations and sought a public apology from Moudgil within three days of receiving the notice.The notice says Rao will file defamation suits, both civil and criminal, for Rs 50 crore even if Moudgil apologises, as her report, coming just a few days before Rao?s retirement, ?has caused untold mental agony to him?.Reacting to the notice on Thursday, Moudgil stuck to her stand.?I have done my duty... There is a complaint pending with the anti-corruption bureau, and it has to look into the matter,? Moudgil said.Moudgil said Australia-based NRI VC Prakash had said in connection with the Election Commission bribery case that he knew the jail officials and had facilitated a meeting between them and Sasikala. ?The ACB will have to look into to this lead,? Moudgil said. ?I?m sure the truth will emerge.?In the notice, a copy of which HT has accessed, Rao?s lawyers have accused Moudgil of leaking her report to Rao on the alleged irregularities even before it reached him. ?Thus, it is clear that publicity was the main intention in writing such a complaint,? the notice says.The notice says Moudgil had some axe to grind against Rao ?and to achieve same you have made baseless allegations and the same has tarnished the image of my client.?Accusing Moudgil of taking photos elsewhere in the prison compound, the notice questions why she could not take photos of the alleged privileges that had been allowed to Sasikala. ?The reason is obvious that you could not take photo of a non-existent kitchen,? the notice says.?You claim that you have taken pictures of irregularities inside the prison. But you have not taken the picture of Sasikala?s separate kitchen and other royal facilities, which are the prime subject of your allegations. You could not take pictures because nothing like that existed,? the notice says.Meanwhile, the inquiry ordered by the chief minister headed by a retired Indian Administrative Service officer is underway. Rao, Moudgil, and jailer Krishna Kumar were transferred to ensure a fair probe, the government had said. The State Human Rights Council is also looking into the matter. "
"A former senior executive at online media startup ScoopWhoop has filed FIR against Co-founder Suparn Pandey accusing him of sexual harassment and assault. The complainant accused Pandey of making inappropriate remarks, sending her a lewd video, being uncomfortably close and publicly commenting on her sexuality. She also accused other Co-founders of abetting harassment and trying to conceal it.","After a series of allegations on social media from several women complaining of sexual harassment, Mumbai Police registered an FIR against CEO and founder of The Viral Fever, Arunabh Kumar. He came out and addressed the accusations made against him and said ""I am a heterosexual, single man and when I find a woman sexy, I tell her she's sexy. I compliment women. Is that wrong?"". The comment obviously did not help his case and he faced massive backlash for the same. After the incident, there were various debates and discussions on work place ethics and sexual harassment. Almost 15 days later, another similar incident has come to light. An FIR has been filed against ScoopWhoop co-founder Suparn Pandey accusing him of sexual harassment and sexual assault, as reported by Catch News.  Along with Suparn Pandey, other co-founders have also been named though for abetting harassment and trying to conceal it.A former senior executive of ScoopWhoop Media Pvt. Ltd filed the FIR at the Vasant Kunj (South) police Station, Delhi. The accused has been charged with section 354 A (sexual harassment), section 509 (insulting the modesty of a woman), and section 506 (criminal intimidation), reported Catch News.  The complainant has claimed that during her tenure at ScoopWhoop, which lasted two years, she faced 'inappropriate comments and lewd remarks' the entire time. Pandey even went on to comment on her sexuality. ""Mr. Suparn Pandey in public commented on my sexuality and this comment included calling me a names (sic.) which reflected on my sexual orientation and my sexual preferences (sic.) as well as characterised me in a certain way"", states the FIR according to a Catch News report . Her ordeal was not limited to verbal harassment, the complainant has claimed that Pandey repeatedly got 'uncomfortably close', 'often trying to play with her hair' . He unabashedly even sent her a lewd video on the company's official Gmail chat, the FIR alleges. 'Mr. Pandey got so bold as to send me a lewd video over the official Gmail chat, in which the words were ""aapnu jeans dheeli karo""', reads the FIR. ScoopWhoop's inactionWhen the complainant, took up the matter with ScoopWhoop co-founder Sriparna Tikekar, she assured her that such behaviour would not be repeated. However, apparently she did not take any action against Pandey. The former senior executive did not stop raising the issue with the company's founders even after realising that it had no repercussions for Pandey. She was instead publicly humilated and was allegedly forced to work in close quarters with Pandey. If she was refused, she was ""reprimanded and humiliated"".Suparn Pandey used to show up to work drunk and would try to touch the complainant. She decided to quit after Pandey crossed all limits. 'Mr. Pandey approached me after the meeting, between 8-9:30PM, when I was alone at my work desk and asked me to be less ""aggressive"" in my dealings with other people and learn to ""pour some sugar on it."" That after that, he then got up, kissed my forehead and walked away,' the complainant recounts in the FIR .  She was allegedly dissuaded from lodging a formal complaint and the co-founders threatened to hurt her career and defame her publicly. Following a series of complaints and threats, she resigned from ScoopWhoop. "

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Friday directed the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to submit an action plan for the restoration of Yamuna floodplains. This comes after an expert committee appointed by the NGT claimed that the ecology of over 420 acres of floodplains was adversely affected by the World Culture Festival organised in 2016 by the Art of Living.,"The restoration of Yamuna floodplains could start soon with the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Friday directing the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and irrigation department of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh to submit an action plan within a week.A bench headed by NGT chairperson justice Swatanter Kumar formed a three-member committee comprising a senior official of the DDA and chief engineers of the irrigation department of Delhi and UP to prepare the plan. ?The committee shall submit an action plan with reference to floodplains of Yamuna where Art of Living?s event was held last year,? the bench said.The tribunal also directed the committee to consult and refer to the findings and suggestions of the expert panel, appointed by NGT earlier, before submitting the restoration action plan. A three-day Word Culture Festival was organised on the river?s floodplains by spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar?s Art of Living in March 2016. An expert committee appointed by the green body had claimed that the ecology of over 420 acres of floodplains was adversely affected by the event. The panel suggested that it would require over Rs 42 crore to execute the plan. Art of Living, however, had challenged the findings on multiple grounds and even appointed its own panel of experts to prepare a parallel report to substantiate their claims. ?Let the restoration work begin. The cost can be debited to the account of whoever is responsible for the damage. We can?t ask the DDA to sit on the report submitted by the expert committee,? the bench observed. The matter would be heard again on a day-to-day basis from July 28 onwards. The action plan would have to be submitted by July 28. The expert committee earlier appointed by the tribunal suggested they would need the help of aquatic plants and animals that once used to inhabit the river?s floodplains to fix the ecological damage. The report had stated that huge de-siltation and dredging would be required to ?physically? rehabilitate the network of wetlands and channels that were damaged and destroyed. The biological rehabilitation ? the process to make the wetlands and channels ecologically functional once again ? would have to be started simultaneously, experts had suggested.This process would take around 10 years at least."

Patrons cheered the president?s inauguration and clapped during moments in his speech when patriotism and promises united in rhetorical embrace.

Here?s the text of Trump?s inauguration speech, as prepared for delivery:Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: thank you.We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come.We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent.Today?s ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another ? but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American People.For too long, a small group in our nation?s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.Washington flourished ? but the people did not share in its wealth.Politicians prospered ? but the jobs left, and the factories closed.The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation?s Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.That all changes ? starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration.And this, the United States of America, is your country.What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.Everyone is listening to you now.You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public.But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.We are one nation ? and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.For many decades, we?ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry;Subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military;We?ve defended other nation?s borders while refusing to defend our own;And spent trillions of dollars overseas while America?s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.We?ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind.The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.From this moment on, it?s going to be America First.Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.I will fight for you with every breath in my body ? and I will never, ever let you down.America will start winning again, winning like never before.We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.We will get our people off of welfare and back to work ? rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American.We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world ? but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones ? and unite the civilized world against Radical Islamic Terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.The Bible tells us, ?how good and pleasant it is when God?s people live together in unity.?We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.There should be no fear ? we are protected, and we will always be protected.We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God.Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action ? constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.The time for empty talk is over.Now arrives the hour of action.Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag.And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words:You will never be ignored again.Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Proud Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And, Yes, Together, We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, God Bless You, And God Bless America.

"Portugal national team captain Cristiano Ronaldo scored with a left-footed long-range effort after his teammate André Silva provided a mid-air backheel assist on an aerial long ball, in Portugal's 3-0 friendly win over Hungary on Sunday. The 32-year-old also scored a freekick from the side of the penalty box, claiming his 70th career goal for Portugal.","While Cristiano Ronaldo kept moving up Europe's all-time scorers list on Saturday, a demoralizing loss to Bulgaria endangered the Netherlands' World Cup qualification.With two goals in Portugal's 3-0 win over Hungary, Ronaldo moved into fourth place on the all-time scorers list for European nations.Ronaldo's 70 in 137 appearances trail only Miroslav Klose (71), Sandor Kocsis (75) and Ferenc Puskas (84).Here is a look at World Cup qualifiers in Europe:BULGARIA STUN NETHERLANDSTeenager Matthijs de Ligt's dream debut for the Netherlands quickly turned into a nightmare as he handed Bulgaria an early goal.Just five minutes into the match De Ligt let a speculative ball fall over his shoulder before he collided with goalkeeper Jeroen Zoet, allowing Spas Delev to tap in.Delev made it 2-0 in the 20th when he curled a shot past De Ligt's attempted block and into the bottom corner of Zoet's goal.Injuries had forced coach Danni Blind to make the risky choice of De Ligt who, at 17, became the youngest Netherlands debutant since Mauk Weber in 1931.After the stunning loss, the manager took the blame.""I blame myself,"" Blind told national broadcaster NOS, adding that, ""It can't go on like this.

"Martin Sorrell, CEO of world's largest advertising and public relations company WPP, was awarded a payout of over $62 million (?400 crore) in 2016. The payout was around 32% less from the $91 million (?585 crore) he received in 2015, one of the biggest in UK's corporate history. With this, Sorrell has received $272 million in total remuneration since 2012.","Sir Martin Sorrell received £48m in remuneration last year as WPP, the marketing and advertising company he founded and runs, moved to curb the level of his future payouts to avoid further clashes with investors.Sorrell, who has been on the receiving end of a string of shareholder voting revolts at WPP?s annual meetings in recent years, received total pay, bonuses and incentive scheme payouts of £48.1m in 2016.The figure is 31.6% lower than the £70.4m he received in 2015, one of the biggest pay deals in UK corporate history, which was opposed by one-third of WPP shareholders at last year?s AGM. The payout, the last to be awarded under WPP?s controversial ?Leap? scheme, means Sorrell has received about £210m in total remuneration since 2012.WPP has introduced a less generous arrangement for Sorrell, which is expected to pay out £19m a year. It will be the subject of a binding vote at the company?s annual meeting in June.However, WPP said on Friday that it intended to tighten the policy further with a potential payout band of £14.9m to £19.2m maximum this year. From 2018, that will fall to between £18m and £13m as dividend equivalent payments are scrapped.The company has moved to stem further potential run-ins with investors at a time of renewed scrutiny of corporate Britain since the Brexit vote and the warning from Theresa May that she would curb boardroom excess. WPP?s chairman, Robert Quarta, appointed at last year?s annual meeting, also said planning to identify the successor to Sorrell, 72, had intensified.?Our succession planning process, which has always been rigorous, has become even more focused and detailed over the past year,? said Quarta, in WPP?s annual report published on Friday. ?Whether it happens in the near or distant future, when Sir Martin leaves his role as chief executive, we will have an exceptional team of potential candidates on the bench.?Sorrell shows no signs of slowing down, having celebrated the birth of another child on the day of the US presidential election last year. He has no plans to step aside and said, on the question of succession, that there is ?nothing to see here?. His pay has been a flashpoint in the past. In 2012, during what became known as the shareholder spring, nearly 60% of investors rejected his annual package for the previous year. Last year, Sorrell defended his remuneration, arguing that he had put three decades of his life into turning WPP from a maker of wire baskets into a global marketing business worth £22bn.?I?m not a Johnny-come-lately who picked a company up and turned it round [for a big payday],? he said. ?If it was one five-year plan and we buggered off, fine [to criticise my pay]. Over those 31 years ? I have taken a significant degree of risk. [WPP] is where my wealth is. It is long effort over a long period of time.?The question of a successor has exercised investors in recent years, with Guy Jubb, the former head of governance at Standard Life Investments, using his final appearance at a WPP annual meeting in 2015 to criticise the apparent ?Sorrellcentricity? at the company.Quarta, writing in the annual report, said there is a list of internal and external candidates who could take over.?As part of our continuous assessment of those individuals who might one day become chief executive of the group, we have invited a number of leaders within WPP companies to present to the board and attend board meetings,? he said. ?This exercise gives me greater confidence than ever in the strength of our people and their potential to succeed at the very top.?This internal pool is, of course, maintained alongside a constantly refined list of external candidates.?Quarta said internal candidates include those who report directly to Sorrell, as well as ?many who currently occupy the senior tier below?."

"The website of National Institute of Technology, Srinagar, was hacked on Monday, with hackers posting ""Free Kashmir"" and anti-Indian Army messages. The portal was hacked by a group named Team Pak Cyber Skullz, who also posted messages demanding the removal of Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. ""Freedom from the evil of the Indian Military,"" one of the posts read.","In an unfortunate series of events that unfolded in the Kashmir Valley in the aftermath of the India-Pakistan tie in the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 at Edgbaston that left the neighbours' nose bloodied, pro-Kashmir elements hacked the official website of the premier National Institute of Technology (NIT) based in Srinagar on Monday, calling for an Azaad Kashmir.NIT Srinagar became a target perhaps for the fact that it had hit headlines after a clash between Kashmiri and non-Kashmiri students last year when the latter cheered India's defeat in the T20 World Cup match against West Indies. The servers were downed after the attack.While the nation was busy grappling with an early-morning terrorist attack on a CRPF station at Sumbal in Bandipora district of Kashmir, which was foiled by jawans and left four terrorists dead, pro-Kashmir freedom elements, most probably from across the border, hacked the website of the premier institute and posted, ""Ask for milk, we shall give you sweets. Ask for Kashmir we shall kill you."" This, ironically, has been the clarion call of the Right wing, which it employs towards those asking for Kashmir's freedom.""We saw that the website had been hacked when some students tried to access it to see a few articles of the syllabus. We were shocked to see that the website bore anti-India literature, anti-Indian Armed Forces propaganda and a call to leave Kashmir and give it freedom,"" one of the students told Mail Today.WHAT THE POSTERS SAID The posters, uploaded in the name of one 'All Pak Cyber Skullz Members', said. ""We shall fight till the last breath. What shall a man not pay for living? Everyday 100s of innocent people are abused, raped and even killed in Kashmir by Indian army, a third of the deaths are children. We don't want war. Take back your guns and go back to where you came from.""""All we ask is for freedom, you can kill us, you can't kill us all, we shall not give up.""

"Japanese electronics maker Sony has unveiled the 'Xperia XZ Premium', the world's first smartphone with 4K HDR display at ?46,700. The phone's 19-megapixel camera has a memory-stacked sensor, making it world's first smartphone camera that records slow motion video at 960 frames per second. The device runs on Android Nougat and has 4 GB RAM and 64 GB inbuilt storage.","Hot on the heels of Nokia, LG and Huawei's, Sony has unveiled their latest Xperia flagship Smartphone - the Xperia XZ Premium at the Mobile World Conference in Barcelona. The Xperia XZ Premium is undoubtedly the company's most exciting device in years and comes with a range of breakthrough features, the chief amongst them being the world's first 4K HDR display in a smartphone. Unlike the LG G6, which has eschewed Qualcomm's latest processor - the Snapdragon 835 in favour of the older Snapdragon 821 in order to gain the first mover advantage over the Galaxy S8, Sony has decided to stick with the 835 for the XZ Premium.The catch here is the fact that the XZ Premium will not be out before Spring, which is quite some time away. Additionally, the smartphone comes with 4GB of RAM, a 3,230mAh battery with QuickCharge 3.0 support and Android 7.0 out of the box. As with previous Xperia's, the power button doubles up as a fingerprint scanner. Also Read:  Nokia 3310 relaunched: What is its price and other questions answeredTouted as a 'game-changing camera', the Sony Xperia XZ Premium comes with an entirely new camera system called the 'Motion Eye' which comes with the world's first memory stacked sensor. Sony has embedded fast memory right into the camera stack which allows the smartphone to capture video at an astonishing 960 frames per second, which is 4 times slower than any other smartphone available today. Sony claims that the ' World's fastest image capture technology in a smartphone' allows the camera to capture instances that occur in the blink of an eye and reveal things beyond what the human vision is capable of seeing. The added memory also brings with it improved predictive capture in the XZ Premium. The device starts to buffer images the moment it detects motion and selects 4 of the best photos by analysing the speed of the moving object.Additionally, the XZ Premium also comes with the same triple-sensor system found in the Xperia XZ, although the sensor's resolution has been reduced slightly to 19 megapixels. It has an aperture of f/2.0 and comes with SteadyShot and an 'Anti-distortion' shutter. On the front, there is a 13MP camera with an aperture of f/2.0 for selfies.Along with the camera, the display is what sets the XZ Premium apart from the competition. It is the first smartphone in the world to come with a 4K HDR display which is 5.5' in size and is also 40% brighter than the Xperia Z5 Premium's panel.The problem with the Xperia Z5 Premium was the fact that there was little or no 4K content available to enjoy on the smartphone. To remedy this, Sony has entered into a partnership with Amazon Prime Video where users will be able to enjoy a selection of 4K HDR content on their smartphones.Lastly, Sony has entered into a partnership with Qualcomm in order to create a new class of devices that are capable of gigabit LTE speeds. The XZ Premium will be the first smartphone to feature the same and offer not only high speeds but much better speeds everywhere. "

"The Defence Ministry has scrapped a ?6,500-crore deal to procure 16 helicopters for the Indian Navy from American firm Sikorsky, according to reports.

It is now learnt that the procurement of these 16 choppers would be merged with a Make in India programme to produce around 140 Naval Multirole Helicopters (NMRH) for equipping all major naval warships with one multirole helicopter each when they go in for blue water missions and anti-piracy patrols.On the need for keeping the deal alive, Defence Ministry sources said, that the American firm would extend the validity of its price bid and also reduce the price of the choppers which was higher than the benchmark set by the government.UPGRADING ANTI-SUBMARINE CAPABILITIESThe 16 multirole helicopters are sought by the Navy for upgrading its anti-submarine warfare capabilities, which are on a decline as the Seaking helicopters bought from the UK in 1980s, would be on their way out from the force in near future, they added.Sikorsky was selected by the Navy for its requirements in December 2014 as it emerged as the only bidder in the race after Finmeccannica was chucked out of competition due to the chopper scam allegations on it.After the tender bid was opened, sources said there was a demand made to raise the price of the choppers to meet inflation, but the defence ministry sought a further cut in the price demanded by the firm originally in its commercial bid.Other issues like liability clause were also responsible for holding up the deal for some time, sources said.Navy sources said the deal is required badly for the force as it has to find a replacement for the SeaKing - 42 choppers bought from British firm Westland helicopters."

"A group of thieves allegedly robbed a jewellery store in Mumbai by drilling a hole in its wall from a vacant store next door, police officials said on Monday. The robbers stole ?8.5 lakh worth of jewellery and left behind ?20 lakh worth of gold kept in an iron safe. Police are probing if the robbery was an inside job.","A group of thieves enter a jewellery shop by drilling a hole from the store next door, steal jewellery kept on display but don?t touch a safe full of gold, and they do so when the CCTV cameras were switched off ? all on a night of heavy rain.

The shop from where the thieves drilled the hole had been closed for three months. They entered through the back room of the jewellery shop and stole Rs8.5 lakh worth of jewellery, while leaving behind the Rs20 lakh worth of gold kept in an iron safe.

Kabadi said.The police said there are several loopholes, from the switched off cameras to the heist being timed when the store?s owner was hospitalised. ?We are questioning workers and the store staff.

"BJP on Monday asserted that the RSS had nothing to do with Yogi Adityanath's appointment as the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister.

"England's leading Test wicket-taker James Anderson has admitted he would've seriously thought about Test captaincy, following Alastair Cook's resignation in February. ""I don't know if I'd have taken the captaincy but it would've been nice to have been considered for it"", the 34-year-old said. He, however, went on to say, ""it makes sense for a younger guy to do it"".","England pace spearhead James Anderson, who is one of the senior members of the national team, has admitted he was a bit disappointed after he was overlooked for the role of Test captain following Alastair Cook's decision to step down from the post.Cook had earlier this year stepped down as England's Test captain after a record 59 matches in charge.

In the past, there have been several instances when the Vice-President of India went on to become the President.While no one knows if history will repeat itself in near future, we take a look at six such people who were first elected as vice-president and later became the country's president.1) Dr S RadhakrishnanIn 1952, Dr S Radhakrishnan and Janab Shaik Khadir Hussain filed nominations for vice-presidential election. The Returning Officer found Radhakrishnan's nomination valid and declared him unopposed to the office of the vice-president on April 25, 1952.

Following Dr Hussain's death in 1969, Giri also took charge as the acting president. He resigned from both the posts, vice-president and acting president, to contest the presidential election. Giri faced stiff competition from N Sanjeeva Reddy but eventually managed to get past the required quota of votes in the second count. Giri was sworn in as the President of India on August 24, 1969.4) R VenkataramanRamaswami Venkataraman assumed the office of vice-president on August 31, 1984. In the vice-presidential election, he secured an easy win over Bapu Chandrasen Kamble, and succeeded M Hidayatullah to the post. In 1987, R Venkataraman succeeded Gyani Zail Singh as the next President. 5) Dr Shankar Dayal SharmaAfter R Venkataram was elected as the President, he tendered his resignation as the vice-president. The election for the post was announced and 27 candidates filed their nomination. On scrutiny, the Returning Officer found only one nomination valid, that of Shankar Dayal Sharma. He was elected unopposed to the post of vice-president and assumed office on September 3, 1987. He fought the presidential election of 1992 and beat competition from G G Swell and Ram Jethmalani. Shankar Dayal Sharma succeeded R Venkataraman as the president and assumed office on July 25, 1992. 6) K R NarayananShankar Dayal Sharma resigned as vice-president after becoming the President, and elections were announced.

"In addition to four BJP MLAs, two AAP MLAs from the 70-member Delhi Vidhan Sabha also voted for the NDA backed presidential candidate Ram Nath Kovind, who won the polls on Thursday. Prior to the polls, AAP had announced support to the opposition's candidate Meira Kumar. The two MLAs who cross-voted are suspected to be among the few suspended legislators.","Besides four Bharatiya Janata Party legislators, there were two more in the 70-member Delhi Vidhan Sabha who voted for Ramnath Kovind, the NDA-backed presidential candidate who emerged the winner  on Thursday.The ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)?suspects the two MLAs who cross voted could be among  the five suspended party legislators. Former water minister Kapil Mishra, who was suspended from the party in March for making corruption allegations against Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, told Hindustan Times that he voted for the ?winning candidate?. ?It is obvious that one would vote for the winning candidate. I am glad that my vote got counted in the final result,? Mishra said on Thursday.  Ahead of the polls, the AAP had announced its support to the opposition?s candidate Meira Kumar. Of the total 69 MLAs of Delhi, 67 -- 63 AAP, 4 BJP -- voted in the presidential polls on Monday. AAP had 67 MLAs initially. However, its strength reduced to 65?after one of its MLA,?Ved Prakash from Bawana joined the BJP?in March just before the municipal elections. The AAP lost the Rajouri Garden seat to BJP?s Manjinder Singh in the byelection.    Despite the four votes from the BJP that went to Kovind, the former governor of Bihar who won with a landslide victory in the Presidential elections on Thursday, got a total of six votes --- which means that two AAP MLAs had cross-voted. Opposition?s candidate Meira Kumar, on the other hand, got 55 votes. Six votes were found invalid. The AAP, however, reacted to the voting pattern on positively and blamed the suspended MLAs for cross-voting. ?While we know for sure Kapil Mishra voted for Kovind, the other one must be some suspended MLA only,? said Saurabh Bhardwaj, AAP spokesperson and MLA from Greater Kailash. Bhardwaj was among the two MLAs who did not vote in the elections as he was out of town. Another MLA Devinder Sehrawat had stayed away from voting. ?It is in fact a proud moment for us that despite there being no whip, our MLAs voluntarily supported Ms Kumar and opposed those who propagate fundamentalism,? Bhardwaj said.Leader of the opposition in Delhi assembly Vijender Gupta said the election result indicates that dissent is simmering in AAP. ?Arvind Kejriwal is unable to keep his flock intact. He had to change his stand. In the beginning, the party had earlier announced to support Meira Kumar but Kejriwal later urged his legislators to vote according to their ?conscience?. What does it mean? He was sure that AAP MLAs could cross-vote. This shows clear insecurity in their leadership,? said the BJP leader.Gupta further added that victory of Kovind is a victory of India?s flourishing democracy. ?His victory has further strengthened our democratic system. I am confident under Kovind?s presidentship, the nation will march on road to progress with greater confidence and faith,? he said. "

According to the woman's statement, she was abducted by three men in a Swift car from near her home in Sohna, Gurgaon at 8.45 pm on Monday. The men then drove her around for four to five hours, taking turns to repeatedly molest and rape her.

"The Vatican has turned off 100 fountains for the first time in years due to a prolonged drought affecting the city state and surrounding Italian city Rome. The Vatican said this was its ""way of living in solidarity with Rome."" Rome, which has also closed drinking fountains, is considering water rationing for as many as eight hours a day. ","Vatican authorities have turned off 100 fountains, including two Baroque masterpieces in St. Peter?s Square, due to a prolonged drought affecting the tiny city state and the city of Rome, which surrounds it. Suffocating summer heat has followed two years of lower-than-average rainfall in Rome, forcing the Italian capital to close drinking fountains and consider the prospect of water rationing.More than a million residents of Rome are facing water rationing for up to eight hours a day as the prolonged heatwave that has ravaged southern Europe takes its toll. Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said it was the first time authorities in the spiritual home of the world?s 1.2 billion Catholics could remember being forced to turn off the fountains. Standing in St Peter?s Square, where two fountains by 17th-century sculptors Carlo Maderno and Gian Lorenzo Bernini stood dry, Burke said the Vatican wanted to help. ?This is the Vatican?s way of living in solidarity with Rome, trying to help Rome get through this crisis,? he told Reuters TV.The measure was initiated on Monday, and all 100 Vatican fountains will be turned off gradually over the coming days. Rome is gasping after 72% less rain than normal fell in July, according to Sky Italia?s weather TV channel. There was 74% less than normal in June, and a 56% reduction from the long-term average across March, April and May. Caring for the planet and its resources is an important issue for Pope Francis, who demanded swift action by world leaders in the first ever papal document dedicated to the environment. ?This decision is very much in line with the pope?s thinking on ecology: you can?t waste and sometimes you have to be willing to make a sacrifice,?

Floods are a natural phenomena in these areas because excessive monsoon rains cause flooding regularly, but shoddy preparedness has only made the situation worse.?There were huge delays in completion of River Management Activities and Works related to Border Areas projects which were long term solutions for the flood problems of Assam, North Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh,? the report found. ?There were discrepancies in execution of works like irregular award of work, splitting of tenders, payment at higher rates.? The CAG report evaluated 206 Flood Management Programme projects, 38 flood forecasting stations, 49 River Management Activities and works related to Border Area projects and 68 large dams in 17 states and Union Territories between 2007 and 2016. They found ?inordinate delays? in almost a quarter of the projects, in release of funds and ultimately completion of projects ranging from 10 months to 13 years.In none of the 17 states were flood prone areas even assessed scientifically.

"The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has claimed to have destroyed over 10,000 mosquito breeding grounds across the city in the last six months. A BMC report revealed that over 62 lakh houses were checked for mosquito breeding and ?20 lakh was collected as fine from residents for not adhering to safety standards. ","The insecticide department of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) visited around 62 lakh houses and found more than 10,000 mosquito breeding spots in 8,744 of them over the past six months. Officials said they collected Rs20 lakh in fine from residents who failed to eliminate mosquito breeding spots in their homes. Rajan Naringrekar, insecticide officer, BMC, said the civic body focussed its efforts on finding breeding grounds of dengue carrier Aedes aegypti and malaria carrier Anopheles stephensi. From January 1 to July 15, 10, 260 breeding spots were found, of which 7,586 had larvae of Aedes aegypti and 2,674 had those of Anopheles stephensi . ?The issue is serious because a single female mosquito lays around 100-150 eggs at a time. She does so four times in her life span, which is three weeks. Negligence could lead to breeding of 400-600 mosquitoes which carry dengue and malaria,? said Naringrekar. Officials said they visited 62.43 lakh houses in the city, some more than once, to destroy breeding spots. ?Not protecting water tanks, wells and surroundings from mosquitoes were the most common offences,? Naringrekar added. Data from the past two years suggested that 80% of dengue patients had breeding spots in or around their homes.Naringrekar  said since mosquitoes only breed in fresh water, people can control the spread of the disease right from their own homes. ?We have been advising residents to clean ornamental trees, feng-shui plants, bamboo plants, money plants, plates, pots, refrigerators and air-conditioners regularly to avoid dengue infection. For malaria too, people have to be cautious because the mosquito can breed wherever rainwater accumulates,? he added."

"Colombia is producing more cocaine than ever before, according to new figures revealed by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. The country produced an estimated 866 tonnes of cocaine in 2016 as compared to 649 tonnes in 2015. Coca crops, the raw material used for cocaine, covered 146,000 hectares in 2016, up 52% from 96,000 in 2015.","Colombia has spent years trying to shake off its reputation as the cocaine capital of the world, but the country is producing more of the drug than ever before, according to new figures from the United Nations.An estimated 866 tonnes of cocaine were produced at clandestine labs across the country in 2016, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). In 2015, the estimate was 649.In terms of the area planted with coca, the raw material used for cocaine, Colombia is back at the same levels as in 2001, when a huge US-backed anti-narcotics effort known as Plan Colombia was just getting under way. Coca crops covered 146,000 hectares in 2016, up 52% from 96,000 in 2015. Higher yields from mature plants mean more cocaine can be produced per hectare planted.The results of the study ?show a complex panorama?, said Bo Mathiasen, the UNODC?s representative in Colombia.José Ángel Mendoza, the head of Colombia?s counter-narcotics police, said Colombia faced ?a difficult historical moment?, but stressed that the figures reflected the state of the country on 31 December 2016.Since then, the government has put in place an ambitious plan to eradicate 100,000 hectares of coca by the year?s end. Half of that amount is to be forcibly eradicated, and the other half removed through crop substitution agreements with coca farmers.The substitution program is part of a peace deal with Farc rebels, who renounced drug trafficking as part of their demobilization deal. During much of the group?s 53 years as an armed insurgency, it financed its fight through the drug trade.Former combatants have committed to work with the government to convince farmers to replace coca crops with another way to make a living.?The history of drug crops is divided in two: before and after the beginning of the post-conflict period,? said Enrique Gil Botero, the justice minister.Already 40% of the goal of forced eradication has been met, and 86,000 families ? who account for as much as 76,000 hectares of coca ? have signed on to crop substitution programs in exchange for subsidies of about $11,000 per farmer over the course of two years, according to the government.?Having the Farc on the side of substitution and not on the other side makes a difference,? said Rodrigo Pardo, who heads the government agency in charge of implementing the peace agreement.But the deal on crop substitution with the Farc, announced before the final peace deal was finalized last year, also provided a perverse incentive for farmers to grow coca, knowing they would later be awarded subsidies. Cocaine production began increasing in 2013, rising steadily every year since. In 2014 the Colombian government ended aerial fumigations in over health concerns.A significant rise in the number of hectares planted with coca, the raw material used in cocaine, had already been reported by the White House, which uses its own measurements. While calculating 180,000 hectares of coca, the US figured the country produced about 700 tonnes of the drug in 2016."

"US President Donald Trump has accused former FBI Director James Comey of leaking classified material by passing a memo of their private conversations to media and called his act ""illegal"". Earlier, the media had reported that Comey, who had been sacked by Trump, shared the private memos containing classified information on meeting Trump. However, the reports were later retracted.","Donald Trump has accused James Comey, the former director of the FBI, of leaking classified material by passing a memo of their private conversations to the press.?James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media,? the president tweeted at 6.40am on Monday. ?That is so illegal!?The allegation, the latest phase of Trump?s war on Comey?s credibility, appeared to come in response to a report first published by the Hill which then gained extensive coverage on the conservative Fox News channel.But Comey?s defenders are likely to object that, even by the Hill?s account, not all the memos he kept were classified, and there is no proof he released one in that category.Comey told a high-profile congressional hearing last month that he had decided to keep a written record of his dealings with Trump because he thought the president ?might lie about the nature of our meeting?.He explained to the Senate intelligence committee: ?I knew there might come a day when I would need a record of what had happened, not just to defend myself, but to defend the FBI and our integrity as an institution and the independence of our investigative function.?He also testified that, following his dismissal, he used a third party to pass to the New York Times the details of conversations with Trump, in the hope of increasing pressure to get a special counsel appointed in the Russia investigation. A special counsel was appointed the day after the resulting Times story.The Hill reported that Comey wrote seven memos ? all considered to be government documents ? about his nine conversations with Trump. Four of the memos had markings making clear they contained information classified at the ?secret? or ?confidential? level, unnamed officials told the website.It added: ?This revelation raises the possibility that Comey broke his own agency?s rules and ignored the same security protocol that he publicly criticised Hillary Clinton for in the waning days of the 2016 presidential election.?The Hill article was discussed at length on Fox and Friends, a favourite show of the president?s, who duly retweeted the clip before adding his own comment.Meanwhile White House counselor Kellyanne Conway seized on the story, describing it as an ?incredible bombshell? during an appearance on Fox and Friends.Conway said: ?The boy scout, choir boy defense doesn?t hold up here because if it contains classified information, he is apparently violating, at the very least, what all FBI members sign ? they sign a document saying you will not do something like this. He was the director of the entire bureau.?The irony to me, anyway ... is that this is exactly the problem that Hillary Clinton had with her illegal server ? the handling of classified and confidential information that Jim Comey was meant to investigate, if not prosecute.? But it is far from certain that the memo the former FBI director released into the public domain was among those classified, and some critics detected an attempt to deflect attention from revelations over Donald Trump Jr?s meeting with a Russian lawyer who had promised damaging information about Clinton.During his appearance at the Senate intelligence committee, Comey recalled a conversation about Trump?s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and said: ?I immediately prepared an unclassified memo of the conversation about Flynn and discussed the matter with FBI senior leadership.?In another exchange, Senator Mark Warner put it to him: ?I found it very interesting that in the memo that you wrote after this 14 February pull-aside, you made clear that you wrote that memo in a way that was unclassified. If you affirmatively made the decision to write a memo that was unclassified, was that because you felt at some point the facts of that meeting would have to come clean and come clear, and actually be able to be cleared in a way that could be shared with the American people??Comey replied: ?Well, I remember thinking, this is a very disturbing development, really important to our work. I need to document it and preserve it in a way, and this committee gets this but sometimes when things are classified, it tangles them up.?"

We wish him well in his future endeavours?.The Hollywood Reporter and ABC News reported on Wednesday that longtime Muppets performer Matt Vogel will take over as Kermit.Kermit was Henson?s signature character, and the centrepiece of the Muppets franchise from 1955 until 1990. When he died it was unthinkable for many to imagine someone else taking on the role.But Whitmire took up the job, and became the only Kermit many of today?s young adults and children have ever known.The two made TV appearances on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, 30 Rock and Saturday Night Live and in films like Muppets Most Wanted and The Muppets.Addressing friends and fans, Whitmire wrote on his blog: ?I just want you all to know that I am sorry if I have disappointed any of you at any point throughout our journey, and to let everyone know that I am devastated to have failed in my duty to my hero.?"

(Johnson, Warne take a dig at Virat Kohli's Team India after Ranchi draw)Also watch:Cheteshwar Pujara is definitely India's wall: Michael Clarke to India TodayThe injury-prone Starc had to return home after Australia were crushed in Bengaluru as India drew level following a heavy defeat in Pune. But the left-arm pacer, far from the maddening action in India, did not want to miss out on the banter and sledging that has dominated the series and took a nasty dig at star India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, promising to hit him on the head when he next visited Australia. (Inability to bowl us out will be hurting India, says Steven Smith)""I look forward to bowling to Ashwin in Australia. (I might) take his advice and hit him on the badge,"" Starc was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au. (Steve Smith says Peter Handscomb, Shaun Marsh repaid his faith)Starc's insensitive comments come on the back of a cheeky response by Ashwin, who had rubbed his forehead with a forefinger after dismissing the Aussie all-rounder during the visitors' failed run-chase at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. (Virat Kohli alleges Australia of disrespecting team physio Patrick Farhart)As Australia stuttered and stumbled in their 188-run chase on a tricky Bengaluru pitch in the second Test, Ashwin, who had rocked the visitors with three wickets before tea, snuffed out the dangerous Starc. As part of the celebrations, Ashwin rubbed his forehead with his index finger. (Sunil Gavaskar says Virat Kohli missed a trick in Ranchi)For those of you wondering why Ashwin did that, here's a recap of what happened in India's second innings. Starc was bowling a fiery spell on Sunday and Abhinav Mukund was in the firing line. As it happened, a top-edge off his bat flew over his head for a six. It was then that Starc rubbed his forehead with his index finger.Ashwin was clearly standing up for a teammate and added insult to Starc's injury after a crucial blow. While India's players have been matured enough to leave the onfield rivalry behind, Starc's latest comments could pave the way for another controversy. In 2014, Australian batsman Phil Hughes was killed after being hit on the head by a bouncer. Ever since, there have been serious concerns after batsmen have copped blows on their headgear. Starc, in retrospection, might be embarrassed with his words. Australia, the pioneers of mental disintegration, have been clearly rattled by India's onslaught over the last two decades. In 2014, the likes of David Warner and Steve Smith were involved in some heated moments with Indian cricketers before Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma responded in kind. "

"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has threatened to bomb tribal schools, accusing them of teaching students to rebel against the government. Duterte condemned insurgents for destroying infrastructure and alleged that the schools were operated by the rebels without government permits. Human rights groups demanded that Duterte retract the threat and warned such an attack would be a war crime.","The Philippine president has sparked alarm among human rights groups after he threatened to bomb tribal schools, accusing them of teaching students to become communist rebels.In a televised news conference on Monday, Rodrigo Duterte condemned insurgents for destroying bridges and torching schools in the countryside but said they were sparing indigenous Lumad schools, which he alleged were operating under rebel control without government permits. ?Get out of there, I?m telling the Lumads now. I?ll have those bombed, including your structures,? the president said. ?I will use the armed forces, the Philippine air force. I?ll really have those bombed ? because you are operating illegally and you are teaching the children to rebel against government.? Human rights groups called on him to retract the threat, warning such an attack would constitute a war crime. US-based Human Rights Watch said international humanitarian law ?prohibits attacks on schools and other civilian structures unless they are being used for military purposes?, adding that deliberate attacks on civilians, including students and teachers, ?is also a war crime?.Leftwing lawmaker Emmi de Jesus of the Gabriela Women?s party asked Duterte to retract the threat, saying government troops may use it as a pretext to attack indigenous schools and communities in the country?s south that have come under threat from pro-military militias in recent years. Angered by recent communist rebel attacks on government forces, including a road gun battle last week that wounded five members of his elite presidential guards, Duterte has called off peace talks with the Maoist guerrillas and threatened their perceived sympathisers.  ?By calling for an attack on schools Duterte is directing the military to commit war crimes,? said Carlos Conde of Human Rights Watch. Conde urged Duterte to sign a 2015 international political statement, the Safe Schools Declaration, that commits governments to supporting the protection of students, teachers and schools in times of armed conflict. Duterte ascended to the presidency in 2016 after campaigning on his extra-tough approach on crime as a prosecutor and later as mayor of southern Davao city. He has remained popular despite thousands of deaths in his nationwide anti-drug crackdown, and his continuing popularity and the ineffective opposition have apparently emboldened him. On Monday night Duterte also called for abolishing the Commission on Human Rights, an independent agency created under the constitution. He demanded that the commission and the government ombudsman, who investigates officials for corruption and other infractions, route requests to investigate police and military personnel through him, and laid down conditions under which he would allow those investigations. Duterte said that if the ombudsman failed to address atrocities committed by insurgents on government forces, ?so that you can get the truth and the whole story, then do not investigate my army and police.?

When you're representing your country, you are supposed to do whatever you're assigned,"" said Rahane.","It's not easy if you have been an India Test captain in March and performing the duties of a 12th man in June but Ajinkya Rahane is a team man to the core, who believes that moment one wears the India jersey, one needs to keep all his insecurities and ego issues at bay. Rahane was the captain during India's series winning Test against Australia at Dharamsala. However in Champions Trophy, he did not get to play a single match and had to perform the duties of a 12th man. But in the West Indies series that followed, he emerged as the top run-getter with Man of the Series award.""If I am the vice-captain of the Test team, it does not mean that I will not be performing my duties as a 12th man in ODIs. The moment you are representing your country, you are supposed to do whatever you are assigned. When I was carrying drinks during the Champions Trophy, I had no ego issues. That's how I am as a person,"" Rahane said.The elegant right-hander made a successful comeback into the ODI playing XI with 336 runs from five ODIs at an average of 67.20 including a hundred and three half-centuries. ""West Indies was a special series for me simply for the consistency that I was able to show. This series is an important one for my ODI career and getting runs in almost all the matches was a really satisfying feeling. I got opportunity to show a different side to my batting and express myself differently,"" said Rahane.For Rahane, more than technical, there were mental adjustments that were really very necessary. Asked to elaborate, Rahane said: ""By instinct, I am an attacking batsman but the pitches in the West Indies required a different mindset. It required patience and at times not get enticed to go for the big ones. Discretion was necessary in shot selection.""And when we talk about discretion, that's where the mind comes into play - to be able to think clearly what are the shots that I am going to play in a particular situation, on a particular kind of pitch,"" he said.For him, what made the knocks special was the pitches in the West Indies which weren't exactly batting friendly with the ones in Port of Spain and Antigua creating difficulties.""Actually the 62 that I got in the first ODI (abandoned due to rain), gave me a lot of confidence. It was my comeback match. I wanted to have a good knock under my belt. Once I got those runs, the second match was even better when I scored that century. The pitches were sluggish in nature and each pitch was so different from one another,"" he stated.The soft-spoken Rahane said that not for once did he feel insecured because he was coming in place of a rested Rohit Sharma, who is again expected to open the innings during the Sri Lanka ODIs.""This is a great phase in Indian cricket where we have so many top quality players competing for a place in the Indian team. It's always good to have competition. As far as I am concerned, I have never ever been insecure in my life.""Although he doesn't want to look too far ahead, Rahane is game about batting at any slot in the limited overs version. ""Actually my spiritual guru tells me one thing. It is very important to live in the present, irrespective of whether you are playing or not. The biggest lesson of life for me is to keep things simple."

"Scientists have developed a lightweight, paper-based device that can harvest energy from body movements. The inner surfaces are coated with gold and a carbon polymer film, comprising the electric nanogenerator. Pressing and releasing the device for a few minutes charged the device to 1 volt, which was enough to power a remote control or a watch, researchers said.","Washington, Apr 17 (PTI) Inspired by the Chinese and Japanese arts of paper-cutting, scientists have developed a light-weight, paper-based device that can harvest energy from body movements to power sensors and watches. Despite the many advances in portable electronic devices, one thing remains constant - the need to plug them into a wall socket to recharge. Portable electronic devices, such as watches, hearing aids and heart monitors, often require only a little energy. They usually get that power from conventional rechargeable batteries. Researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology in the US and Chongqing University in China wanted to see if they could untether small energy needs from the wall socket by harvesting energy from a users body movements. They have been working on this approach in recent years, creating triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) that can harness the mechanical energy all around us, such as that created by our footsteps, and then use it to power portable electronics. However, most TENG devices take several hours to charge small electronics, such as a sensor, and they are made of acrylic, which is heavy. Researchers turned to an ultra-light, rhombic paper-cut design a few inches long and covered it with different materials to turn it into a power unit. The four outer sides, made of gold- and graphite-coated sand paper, comprised the devices energy-storing supercapacitor element. "

The bears have been reintroduced to the mountain region over the past three decades after being wiped out by hunters.The sheep, which belonged to a farmer in Couflens, south-west France, are thought to have taken fright when the bear appeared in the area last Sunday.After the predator attacked one of the sheep, 209 others in the flock panicked and hurled themselves off a 200 metre-high cliff on the border between France and Spain. The bodies of 169 sheep were found the next day at the foot of the cliff in the Spanish village of Lladorre. The other dead animals were found in France.The Spanish news agency Europa Press said bear fur had been found on one of the dead sheep and would be analysed to try to establish exactly what had happened.Although the French government will compensate the farmer for his loss, the incident has provoked an angry response from the local branch of the French farmers? federation.?Pastoralism ? which protects biodiversity and keeps the mountains alive ? is not compatible with the reintroduction of large predators,? said the Confédération Paysanne de l?Ariège.The last female brown bear native to the Pyrenees was shot dead by hunters in 2004.

"Tesla has fired engineer AJ Vandermeyden who accused the automaker of ignoring her complaints of sexual harassment and paying her less than her male counterparts. Vandermeyden had claimed she was taunted and catcalled by male employees. The company argued that she received special treatment at the expense of others, yet chose to ""pursue a miscarriage of justice by suing Tesla.""","A female engineer at Tesla who accused the car manufacturer of ignoring her complaints of sexual harassment and paying her less than her male counterparts has been fired in what her lawyer alleges was an act of retaliation.AJ Vandermeyden, who went public with her discrimination lawsuit against Elon Musk?s car company in an interview with the Guardian in February, was dismissed from the company this week.Vandermeyden had claimed she was taunted and catcalled by male employees and that Tesla failed to address her complaints about the harassment, unequal pay and discrimination. ?It?s shocking in this day and age that this is still a fight we have to have,? she said at the time.In a statement to the Guardian, Tesla confirmed the company had fired Vandermeyden, saying it had thoroughly investigated the employee?s allegations with the help of a ?a neutral, third-party expert? and concluded her complaints were unmerited.?Despite repeatedly receiving special treatment at the expense of others, Ms Vandermeyden nonetheless chose to pursue a miscarriage of justice by suing Tesla and falsely attacking our company in the press,? a Tesla spokesperson said. ?After we carefully considered the facts on multiple occasions and were absolutely convinced that Ms Vandermeyden?s claims were illegitimate, we had no choice but to end her employment at Tesla.??This was absolutely shocking for AJ. She is devastated,? Therese Lawless, Vandermeyden?s attorney, said by phone. ?She brought the lawsuit in an attempt to make the workplace at Tesla more equitable and fair and to have Tesla comply with the law.?Asked about Tesla?s justification for the firing, Lawless said: ?They?ve just proven our case. It?s clear retaliation.? She added: ?Somebody is trying to instill in employees that when they speak out about matters they are legally allowed to speak out about, they too will be fired.? Vandermeyden?s firing is likely to reignite debate over employment standards in Silicon Valley, where startups and major tech corporations are grappling with complaints of systemic wage disparities, gender discrimination and sexual misconduct.An account of alleged sexism at Uber went viral earlier this year, fueling debate about harassment in the industry, while a recent federal lawsuit against Google has placed a spotlight on concerns about tech firms underpaying women.  Lawless, who represented the former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao in her high-profile discrimination lawsuit, against the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, said she intended to file a formal retaliation complaint on behalf of Vandermeyden. ?It is illegal in the state of California for an employer to retaliate against an employee who asserts her rights, including her rights to receive equal pay as her male colleagues.?Vandermeyden, who started working at Tesla in 2013, claims in her lawsuit that she was paid less than male engineers whose work she directly took over as a manufacturing engineer in the general assembly department.Her complaint further alleged that she raised issues about flaws in the quality testing of cars that her supervisors and male engineers had missed. Although she came up with a solution, men were granted positions over her, she alleged. The complaint said that she and other female engineers were denied promotions despite the fact that they were ?equally or more qualified? than the men.Vandermeyden also alleged that she experienced ?unwelcome and pervasive harassment by men on the factory floor including but not limited to inappropriate language, whistling, and catcalls?.Further, the lawsuit accused Tesla of retaliating against her for speaking up. Management allegedly told her that in order to advance her position, she would need to achieve a performance standard in the factory that was not expected of male engineers and was unattainable. Although she had positive performance evaluations, she felt she had to transfer out of general assembly to the purchasing department, according to the lawsuit, which also said that Tesla retaliated against her for being a ?whistleblower?. Tesla has continued to strongly reject Vandermeyden?s claims. A spokesperson said the company had ?conducted a thorough internal investigation? and ?extensively re-reviewed all the facts?, repeatedly concluding that her allegations were false. Tesla added that Vandermeyden had been granted numerous positions ?over other more qualified candidates? and was ?given special treatment and opportunities for advancement that were unwarranted based on her qualifications?.?The termination was based on Ms Vandermeyden behaving in what the evidence indicates is a fundamentally false and misleading manner, not as a result of retaliation for the lawsuit,? the spokesperson added. ?It is impossible to trust anyone after they have behaved in such a manner and therefore continued employment is also impossible.?The Vandermeyden case is one of several labor issues that have dogged Tesla, which is facing growing scrutiny over its practices in California. Earlier this month, the Guardian published an investigation into working conditions at Tesla?s ?factory of the future? in Fremont, California, where several factory workers complained about their treatment at the plant.Incident reports revealed that ambulances have been called more than 100 times since 2014 for workers experiencing fainting spells, seizures, dizziness, abnormal breathing and chest pains. A recent report from a worker safety organization found that Tesla workers were injured at a rate 31% higher than the industry average in 2015.The company has said it has significantly improved safety standards in recent months at the factory, and Musk told the Guardian he cared deeply about the health and wellbeing of his employees. Vandermeyden, in her interview with the Guardian in February, emphasized that she believed Tesla was a ?revolutionary and innovative company? and said she took out a hefty loan to buy the cheapest version of the Model S car.?Until somebody stands up, nothing is going to change,? she added. ?I?m an advocate of Tesla. I really do believe they are doing great things. That said, I can?t turn a blind eye if there?s something fundamentally wrong going on.?At the time, Vandermeyden said she was hopeful her lawsuit and public comments would not end her career at the company. But she expressed some concern that her decision to speak out could result in retaliation. ?Half the time when I walk into work,? she said, ?I wonder if my badge is going to work.?Contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com"

The Jakarta-based rights group the Setara Institute described the verdict as a ?trial by mob?, while the British ambassador to Indonesia, Moazzam Malik, who is Muslim, tweeted a message of support.I know Ahok. Admire his wk for Jkt. Believe he isn't antiMuslim. Praying for BuVero&kids. Leaders must step up to protect tolerance&harmony. https://t.co/JcxsteEfB4At City Hall on Wednesday morning, an estimated 1,000 people wearing red and white, Indonesia?s national colours, gathered for a spontaneous choir performance in support of Ahok. Conducted by the musician Addie MS, the crowd sang the national anthem, Indonesia Raya, and Pancasila Garuda, a song about Indonesia?s founding principles of unity and diversity.When words fail, music speaks #paduansuarabalaikota #ahok #saveahok #peace #nkrihargamati #garudapancasila pic.twitter.com/CdY64EGiDNOthers registered their opposition to the verdict and sentencing by tweeting under the hashtag #RIPHukumIndonesia, which means ?rest in peace Indonesian law?.The Ahok case has been watched closely as a marker of the commitment to religious tolerance and pluralism in Indonesia, where religious hardliners have been playing an increasingly prominent role in politics.In an unusual move, the panel of five judges on Tuesday dismissed the prosecutor?s recommendations to drop the initial blasphemy charges due to insufficient evidence. Prosecutors had recommended the governor instead face a sentence of two years? probation, and one year in jail if he reoffended. But the judges ? citing among others the ?expert? opinion of an Islamic vigilante group leader ? said they found the minority governor convincingly guilty of blasphemy, incarcerating him for two years. Ahok for months faced the wrath of hardline Islamists after he cited a Qur?anic verse on the campaign trail last September. The verse, he said, had been manipulated by some religious leaders to justify the claim the Muslims should not vote for non-Muslim leaders.Uproar over an edited version of the speech that went viral spilled into a series of angry mass rallies spearheaded by Islamists since late last year, and has catalysed the deepening of religious and ethnic divides in the capital.Some observers argue that religious hardliners may have swayed the Indonesian judiciary.International human rights organisations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said the verdict would tarnish Indonesia?s reputation for religious tolerance and pluralism, and urged the country to repeal its ?unjust? blasphemy law. Ahok has indicated he will appeal against the ruling."

Mumbai's 172-year-old Sir JJ Hospital on Sunday reportedly got its first case of cadaver donation when a 38-year-old brain-dead woman's organs were donated by her family to the hospital. The hospital transplanted her liver and eyes in three patients. The woman was reportedly admitted to the hospital after she met with an accident and was declared brain-dead after some days.,"Maharashtra?s largest public medical facility, Sir J?J?Hospital, reported its first cadaver donation this month after the family of a  38-year-old brain-dead patient from Jalgaon, Sangita Mahajan, donated her body.The liver from the cadaver was transplanted to a 68-year-old end-stage organ failure patient at Jupiter Hospital,Thane, while the corneas were retained by JJ Hospital for transplants. Doctors from the hospital said that Mahajan had met with an accident on July 17 while she was shopping in a market. After treatment for three days at a local hospital, she slipped into coma, and her relatives moved her to Sir JJ Hospital for further treatment. ?The doctors, after an initial check-up, informed the family that Mahajan is brain-dead and asked if they would like to opt for cadaver donation. Surprisingly, the family, was impressed with Medical Education Minister Girish Mahajan?s appeal to people to opt for cadaver donation and agreed to donate heart, kidney, liver and corneas,? said Dr TP Lahane, dean, JJ Hospital. The heart and kidneys couldn?t be used as the organs were not fit to be transplanted. The corneas were transplanted in two patients, a 60-year-old man and a 48-year-old woman.?The doctors were so excited that even head of the departments of concerned specialties, along with their teams were present throughout the night till the donation process was complete. We will now try to increase the frequency of donations at the hospital,? Dr Lahane added."
"US President Donald Trump personally dictated a misleading statement which his son Donald Trump Jr delivered on his meeting with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 presidential election campaign, according to a Washington Post report. In his statement, Trump Jr said he discussed the adoption of Russian children with the lawyer who had offered damaging information on Hillary Clinton.","Donald Trump personally dictated the press statement issued in the name of his eldest son Donald Jr that misleadingly downplayed the significance of a 2016 meeting with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer, a new report alleged on Monday night.According to the Washington Post, Trump personally intervened to prevent senior White House advisers from issuing a full and truthful account of the meeting on 9 June 2016 in which Donald Trump Jr, the president?s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and then presidential campaign manager Paul Manafort came face-to-face with four Russians. One of the Russian visitors was the well-connected lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.The report, based on multiple though largely anonymous sources that included the president?s own advisers, has the potential to cause political, and even legal, trouble for the White House because it draws Trump himself much closer into the fray over the Trump Tower meeting, which has become a lightning rod in the Russian affair.Shunning the guidance of lawyers and overturning the view apparently reached by Kushner and his team of advisers that a full and frank accounting should be made, Trump reportedly dictated a statement on board Air Force One as he was flying back to Washington from the G20 summit in Germany. As would soon become apparent, it gave a very partial and distorted account of events.In the release the 2016 meeting was presented, in Trump?s own words, as ?a short introductory meeting? dominated by discussion of the adoption of Russian children that was ?not a campaign issue at the time?.That statement was presented to the New York Times on 8 July, and duly included in the newspaper?s first account of the meeting. But within 24 hours, highly damaging revelations had emerged that made clear the meeting had been much more charged than that.On 9 July, the Times revealed that Trump Jr had been lured into talking to Veselnitskaya by the promise of negative intelligence on his father?s presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, and two days after that the email chain was published that showed the younger Trump reveling in the idea of receiving dirt on the Democratic presidential candidate, uttering the gleeful phrase: ?I love it?.The Trump Tower meeting has proved to be one of the most toxic pieces of information to emerge so far in the billowing investigation into possible ties between Trump associates and Russia in the Kremlin?s efforts to skew the presidential outcome in favor of the Republican nominee. The special counsel leading the investigation, Robert Mueller, is understood to be looking closely at the event and has reportedly asked the White House to preserve all documents relating to it.Until now, the president managed to keep some distance from the 9 June encounter, with his lawyers claiming that he knew nothing about it. But the new report that Trump personally oversaw the issuing of a misleading account of the proceedings raises questions about the president?s role in what could be conceived as a cover-up.It comes as Mueller has already expanded his inquiry to include the issue of whether Trump was engaging in a possible obstruction of justice when he fired James Comey, having tried and failed to persuade the then director of the FBI to back off investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynn?s contacts with Russian officials.A lawyer for the president issued the Washington Post with a curt statement: ?Apart from being of no consequence, the characterizations are misinformed, inaccurate, and not pertinent,? Jay Sekulow said.The new details of the president?s role in what turned out to be a major communications fiasco come on the day that his current communications chief, Anthony Scaramucci, was dismissed from the White House after barely 11 days. The blunt removal was made on the first day of the new White House chief of staff, John Kelly, who has vowed to introduce the kind of discipline that the West Wing has been sorely lacking.The day began shortly before 5.30am with Trump tweeting ?No WH chaos!? and ended with him saying: ?A great day at the White House?. But as the Washington Post?s forensic deconstruction of the framing of the Trump Tower meeting shows, the president himself has the capacity to destroy even the best-laid plans, underlining the task now facing his new chief of staff.According to the Post, senior White House officials together with the circle around Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, had spent days rehearsing various ways to address the Trump Tower meeting publicly.Kushner?s team was reported to have decided that it was better to ?err on the side of transparency? because the whole truth would eventually come out.Trump, however, appeared to have seen things differently."

"A Tech Mahindra employee was asked by an HR executive to resign by 10 AM the next day or else face termination, an audio clip revealed.

When the employee tried to reason with her, she told him the company reserves all rights to let associates go whenever it wants.","Like it or not, but, the IT job market in India is seemingly crashing. In fact, it's been on the verge of a catastrophic breakdown for quite some time now, with big-ticket companies looking to both hand over pink slips to incumbent employees as well as hire less talent. Nearly 2 lakh jobs are said to be at stake. The fact that a number of these pink slips are apparently being handed over to employees on short notice catching them completely off-guard makes matters worse.In one such incidence, a Bengaluru-based Tech Mahindra employee was reportedly asked - or rather instructed - to hang his boots as part of the company's restructuring plans. He was literally instructed by an HR manager to put in his papers the next morning or else face the axe. Now on a regular day, and inside an IT company, one would expect an employee to be given a fair amount of time to look for alternatives. Only, this wasn't the case at Tech Mahindra. To further cement the unfair treatment meted out to him, the employee managed to record his conversation with the HR and then went on to upload the same on Soundcloud. ""Cost optimisation is happening at the company and your name is part of that list. If you can put in papers we will be treating it as a normal exit with June 15 as last working day, if not, we will be sending you a termination letter,"" the HR executive is heard saying in the 6:45-minute long audio clip.

The same is mentioned in the offer letter that the employees are asked to sign at the time of joining.    "
"A rare 60-kg sperm whale on Thursday washed ashore at Rajodi beach near Mumbai. The fishermen said that the seven-and-a-half-foot-long mammal looked injured and died during rescue operation. ""This species of whale has not washed ashore along the state's coastline for more than a decade,"" said a member of the Konkan Cetacean Research Team.","In a rare incident along the state?s coastline, a seven-and-a-half-foot-long  sperm whale washed ashore at Rajodi beach, Virar, around 3pm on Thursday.Though the state mangrove cell confirmed that it was a sperm whale, the officials are unclear whether it was a juvenile whale or a pygmy or a dwarf (subspecies). The whale weighed 60 kg. Fishermen from Rajodi said they spotted the whale close to the shoreline towards the south side of the beach and it looked injured. ?The mammal most likely hit a large rock close to the shoreline and got injured. We tried pulling it out, but it died as soon as it came close to the beach. We informed the forest department but nobody showed up at the spot,? said James Rodrigues, a fisherman and Rajodi beach resident. ?Along with seven others, we buried the animal near the spot where it had washed ashore. We have not seen a mammal like this at this beach before.?When HT contacted the forest officers from Vasai-Virar, they were unaware of the beaching incident. According to the Konkan Cetacean Research Team (KCRT), the last documented evidence of this mammal to have beached is from Goa in March 2016. ?This species of whale has not washed ashore along the state?s coastline for more than a decade. It is extremely rare and our team is going to collect tissue samples and study the mammal,? said Mihir Sule, member, KCRT. This was the 15th case of dead marine animal carcass washing ashore along Mumbai?s beaches. Between 2015 and 2017, 74 carcasses have washed ashore along the city?s coastline. Both the dwarf and the pygmy sperm whales are protected under schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Owing to lack of information about the species, the mammal is not listed under the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). "

If this kind of a set-up happens, it will be the biggest set-up ever,? says Akshay.The actor not only rooted for the Indian women?s team but also met them after the match. ?I was talking to the girls and one of them said that it would be so much fun if Virat Kohli ran from one side and a lady was on the other side [of the batting pitch],? he says.    ?Even Broken Hearts Can Laugh!!? ?These Women have started a Revolution and I couldn't be more proud ?? #WWC17Final ? A post shared by Akshay Kumar (@akshaykumar) on Jul 23, 2017 at 11:17am PDT How did the idea come to him? ?I was watching a Wimbledon [tennis] match on my phone recently and this idea just struck me,? he says, and adds laughing, ?On the train.?The actor, who has been training women in self-defence free of cost for the past three years, feels that the Indian women?s cricket team no longer needs to be seen as underdogs. ?Now they don?t require any [more] encouragement. Trust me, they have arrived. I watched them play and it was revolutionary. I met them and I told them that they had reasons to be sad but no reason to give up,? says Akshay.Follow @htshowbiz for more"
The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has issued a notice to NGO Praja Foundation for 'misrepresenting' data in a report stating that a third of the children in BMC schools are malnourished. Officials accused the NGO of not factoring in changes in the screening process for malnourishment. The civic body demanded a public apology and threatened legal action against the NGO.,"The deputy municipal commissioner of the civic body has issued a notice to NGO Praja Foundation for mis-representing facts in their data on malnutrition in BMC schools. Calling NGO Praja?s report a farce to malign the public body, the deputy commissioner has demanded a public apology or threatened the NGO with legal action.Praja Foundation had, earlier this year, revealed that despite an extensive mid-day meal programme, a third of the children in schools run by India?s richest municipal corporation in the country?s richest city are malnourished. The report that quotes the corporations own data, obtained through a right-to-information request, pointed out that malnutrition has increased more than four times in Mumbai, from eight per cent in 2013-14 to 34 per cent in 2015-16.?It seems like while preparing this report you have ignored the procedural change involved in screening for malnutrition, which was based on age and weight of the child till 2013-2014, whereas in 2014-15 and 2015-16, screening for malnutrition was based on height and weight. Accordingly, comparison of 8% in 2013-14, 26% in 2014-15 and 34% in 2015-16 is not appropriate,? said Milin Sawant, DMC (education) in the letter.Officials further said that the data was used by the NGO conveniently without bringing the fact of procedural change in screening in public domain.?It appears from the language used in your foreword, that the aim of the whole exercise was to malign a public body. This has completely shaken the credibility and robustness of your report and your organisation,? the officials said.Nitai Mehta, Founder and Managing Trustee of the Praja Foundation, in the foreword of the report had written, ?We cannot compare Mumbai to Shanghai if many wards in the city have malnutrition rates worse than sub-saharan Africa.?The letter further mentions that NGO Praja foundation should issue a public explanation or public apology, and if not, be ready to face legal action.

"Opener Rishabh Pant, who is making his international debut in the T20I against England at Bengaluru on Wednesday, has become India's youngest T20I debutant. Rishabh, aged 19 years, 120 days, has gone past Ishant Sharma, who made his India T20I debut aged 19 years, 152 days. Rishabh was selected after scoring a triple century in the Ranji Trophy this season.","Hello and welcome to our Live coverage of the third and deciding T20I between India and England in Bengaluru. Stay tuned as we bring you all the latest updates. (LIVE SCORECARD)Virat Kohli: Coming back here after a while. It has been a long time since we played the IPL final. Even after losing all three tosses, we won the series, just like the Test series. It is not a very bad thing to have MS Dhoni behind the stumps. I am new to the limited overs format and I keep taking help. A lot of credit goes to them. Yes, that too and that one over from Jordan to Yuvi. We thought 175-180, but that over took us to 200. Credit to Chahal, he knows the ground better. I have a lot of faith in him and he plays his cricket with confidence. He has to maintain his orginality and it is great to have a guy who has so much zeal. I wanted to send him up, but he is the one to say he will bat down the order. He is a champion player and he is a match-winner. Come to the big game, he stepped up. It is a memorable tour. When we went to England we lost the Test series. It has been a brilliant couple of months for this side. Yuzvendra Chahal: I felt nice playing my first match at Bengaluru for India. I have bowled in the poweplay in the IPL and Virat has the confidence in me to give me the ball. I plan according to how the batsman plays. Even Dhoni used to tell me what the batsman is going to play. Mishy bowled well in the last match as well, looking at him I get the confidence to toss the ball up. Eoin Morgan: We lost two in batsmen and it really hurt us. It was an excellent spell from Chahal. Credit should be given where it is due. India played the better cricket today. Beautiful wicket to bat and we would have taken 190-200 at the beginning. We take a lot of things. The biggest thing is our bowling. We showed improvement in our bowling department. Tonight's batting performance has been our worst in a couple of years. Yuzvendra Chahal wins the Man-of-the-Series award for taking 8 wickets in three matchesYuzvendra Chahal wins Man-of-the-Match award for taking 6/25 Mishra: Chahal and I had worked out where to bowl on this pitch to stop runs.Yuvi: Dhoni and I have good understanding. Tried my best. Bangalore has always been a batting paradise. We put up a very good total and the bowlers bowled very well. 202 was a par score in Bangalore. Great bowling performance by the bowlers. Mishra set the tone today and Chahal was able to get the wickets from the other end.  And it is a wrap! Test series 4-0, ODI and T20I series 2-1 #INDvENG#TeamIndia@Paytmpic.twitter.com/IX9u2vheCkThe Men in Blue have done it again. They have won the series 2-1! They beat England in the Tests, in the ODIs and now in the T20Is. In the series decider, India set a huge target in front of the visitors. It was a great collective batting performance from the hosts. They started with the ball in a great fashion too as they sent packing Billings on a golden duck. Series deciders:ODI vs NZ, 2016: NZ 63/2 to 79 all out. Amit Mishra 5/18T20I vs Eng,2017: Eng 119/2 to 127 all out. Chahal 6/25#INDvENGJason Roy and Joe Root then steadied the ship. The stitched a 47-run partnership in just 29 deliveries for the second wicket. Roy then fell to Mishra. Once again, Morgan came out in the middle and kept England in the run chase. He and Root together put up 64 runs in 43 balls. However, they then started the collapse as a tight over from Mishra which led England needing 86 off 42 deliveries. The pressure got the better off the visiting side as Morgan and Root departed in back-to-back deliveries. It was a horrendous performance from thereon as they lost 8 wickets for 8 runs in the space of 18 deliveries. Buttler who got promoted above Stokes once again failed while Stokes and Ali too couldn't do anything as they had a daunting task ahead of them. 22.17 IST:OUT! Edged and taken! Full and wide outside off, Mills slashes hard but only gets a thick outside edge which goes through the slip cordon. Virat Kohli has stationed himself at wide first slip but does well to get across to his left to take a good catch.

England 123-6 (15.1) 22.04 IST: WICKET! England losing their wickets way quickly now. A short ball outside off, Buttler gets across to pull but gets a top edge due to the extra bounce. The ball goes straight up in the air and Virat Kohli takes a simple catch running to his right from mid off. The promotion of Buttler does not work for England and they now need 84 from 34 balls.22.01 IST: OUT! Two in two for India as Root is trapped in front by Chahal for 42.

Gets a top edge instead and the ball balloons high in the air. Dhoni gets under it near the short leg region and collects it easily. The danger man, Roy departs!

Tossed up on middle and leg, Roy kneels and sweeps it over long leg for a boundary. There were more sixes than fours in Indian innings - 12 vs 11. Has happened only twice before for India in a complete match.#INDvENG21.07 IST: After fielding, Kohli throws the ball at Chahal. He is not alert and instead of whipping the bails off he turns and throws it to the keeper's end. Dhoni doesn't even pick the ball and shouts on Chahal! Roy gets a reprieve! 21.03 IST: Joe Root is the new man in! Only second time 5 Indian batsmen have scored at a SR of 140 (or more) in same innings. Other instance was vs SL (Nagpur, 2009).#INDvENG20.57 IST: WICKET! Quicker one sliding in, Billings looks to play it across the line but yorks himself. The ball goes off the inside edge onto the boots and towards gully. Raina from first slip dives and grabs the ball.20.54 IST: SIX! Tossed up on middle and off, Roy brings out his reverse slog. Slogs it over point for a maximum. 20.51 IST: We are back for the chase! Jason Roy and Sam Billings are the two who have come out to open.

Seems to be a bridge too far. But then this is M.Chinnaswamy where anything is possible. The conditions are not totally against India, with the pitch playing a bit two-paced and the ball stopping on the batsmen a bit. How the bowlers handle the dew will be key. Stay tuned for the run chase. England were very inconsistent tonight. Whether it was the short boundaries, or the dew, one can't say but surely they would not have planned to concede 118 in the last 9 overs. Of those, only two overs went below 10, with the lower value being 8. Tymal Mills and Ben Stokes were impressive, finishing with 1/32 each in their 4 overs while we saw the other side of Chris Jordan tonight, going for 56 in his 4 overs. Strangely, Plunkett bowled just 2 overs with Morgan preferring to bowl 6 overs out of Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid, yielding a total of 53 runs without any wicket.Pandya's run out from the last ball & India finish 202-6 - will we chase it & win the series? #INDvENGFind out ð??? https://t.co/MZ6wQXunehpic.twitter.com/yuSEivZQKHSo India finish on a commanding total. This is the first time a team has crossed the 200-run mark in T20Is at this venue. Did not look like they will do so at the halfway mark but scintillating knocks from Raina and Dhoni made it possible. 20.41 IST: MS Dhoni's maiden fifty (56), Suresh Raina's 63 help India post 202 vs England in 20 oversIt has taken MS Dhoni 10 years & 66 innings to score his maiden T20I fifty- the longest for any player in terms of time & innings.#INDvENG20.41 IST: RUN OUT! Fuller on middle and leg, Pandya clips it through mid-wicket. Stokes the man in the deep, rushes towards the ball and hurls a throw at the striker's end. Buttler collects it and calmly whips the bails off. INDIA FINISH ON 202/6! 20.40 IST: SIX! Jordan once again fails to find his mark and Pandya takes full advantage of it. Lofts it over long on. Roy present there jumps to the fullest, gets hand to it but fails to hold onto it. 20.39 IST: OUT! DHONI DEPARTS! Banged in short, Dhoni is surprised by that and takes his eyes off the ball as he goes for a pull.20.38 IST: FOUR! Low full toss, Dhoni hits it powerfully straight down the ground. There's no long off in place but not sure even he would have stopped it. A boundary is signalled! 20.35 IST: FOUR! That spoils a good over for England!

Slower one does the trick for Mills! Yuvraj out for 26. Back of a hand slower one, Yuvraj who has backed long way already, is beaten by the lac of pace on it. He tries to adjust but the ball goes off the leading edge straight into the gloves of Buttler. Timely wicket for England as Yuvraj was looking very threatening. That's end of a superb cameo from Yuvraj! Also, the end of a 57-run partnership! IND 179/4 in 18.3 overs.

Rahul was already through his shot even before the ball reached him. It went past the bat and hit the middle stump. The 61-run stand is broken in 37 balls. IND 67/2 in 8 over.

IND 39/1 in 5 overs 19.24 IST: IN THE AIR... SAFE! Miscommunication in the field now. A length ball on middle and leg, Raina looks to go over the on side now but mistimes this one too. It goes off the toe end of the bat towards the region between mid on and mid-wicket. Chris Jordan is at mid on, Moeen Ali is at mid-wicket but both leave it to each other.

Effortlessly done! Full and on middle and off, Rahul flicks it without any fuss over square leg. There is a man in place in the deep but he is at mid-wicket and the ball meets the fence! Even Plunkett is amazed at that shot. 19.17 IST: SIX! Lovely shot! Finally Raina gets one away.

IND 17/1 in 3 overs  19.13 IST: Suresh Raina realising that India need to capitalise on the fielding restrictions. Both Raina and Rahul are trying to up the ante and take the attack to the opposition. IND 8/1 after 2 overs 19:06 IST: OUT! Virat Kohli run-out. The India captain scored for an impossible single, Rahul sent him back and Jordan, the bowler picked the ball up and an easy direct hit sent Kohli on his way back. India 4/1 from 1.1 overs. Suresh Raina walks in next19.00 IST: KL Rahul and Virat Kohli walks in to open the innings. The balls comes onto the bat quite well in Bengaluru and they will look to set a total of 170-180. England bat deep and with the dew coming in later on, India will have their work cut out to post a good total on the board.18.49 IST: England was lucky for the third time in a row.

Liam Dawson misses out, Liam Plunkett comes back.18.41 IST: Virat Kohli: Seeing the wicket how dry it is, maybe it will be perfect to bat on in the first half. Just felt a bit of dew while practicing now. We have to bat better than the last two games. The surface is pretty dry. I think it is going to break a bit. I think it is going to help the spinners a bit in the second innings. We got to put up a big total because this is a high-scoring ground.

They may have displayed fighting abilities and also won the opening game, but the hosts will still have their nose ahead at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium."
"Authorities have removed the copies of the Bible and Quran placed near APJ Abdul Kalam's memorial in Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu, following a complaint. Kalam's relatives had placed the books alongside the sculpted Bhagavad Gita placed near the statue before its inauguration. Later, a Hindu nationalist party filed a complaint saying keeping them without permission is wrong.","Indian authorities have removed a copy of the Bible and the Quran from a new statue of a former president after a complaint by a Hindu nationalist party, officials said Tuesday.The removal of the books has fuelled a religious row over a carving depicting a Hindu holy book placed next to the statue of APJ Abdul Kalam at Rameswaram in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.Kalam, who as a scientist played a leading role in India?s landmark 1998 nuclear weapons tests, was president from 2002-2007 and a strongly secular figure.The sculpted Hindu Bhagvad Gita book was placed next to the statue before it was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week on the second anniversary of Kalam?s death.Relatives placed the Bible and the Quran next to the Gita in protest. That infuriated the Hindu Makka Katchi nationalist party, which said it made the complaint to police.?The authorities removed the Bible and the Quran at the site. We are also looking at the complaint filed with us,? police superintendent Om Prakash Meena said. K Prabhakaran, a member of the Hindu Makkal Katchi, told an?English newspaper, ?I respect all these books. But keeping them (at the memorial) without permission is wrong. Steps should be taken to see such things are not done again.? Authorities have since prevented photographers from taking images of the statue. Memorial officials did not respond to queries. Kalam was born into poverty and sold newspapers as a child to support his family while studying. His work on India?s own nuclear weapon earned him the nickname of ?India?s missile man?."

"Responding to a petition claiming that Kangana Ranaut's character in 'Rangoon' is based on Australian stunt actor Mary Evans, popularly known as 'Fearless Nadia', the makers have said that one cannot copyright a character in India. ""It's like calling Hema Malini the 'dream girl'... Now one cannot have a copyright over dream girl,"" said an advocate.","Justice KR Shriram will be convening his court at 10 am on Thursday so that he can finish hearing the arguments with regards to the release of film Rangoon, and probably pass an order. The court is hearing a petition filed by Wadia Movietone Pvt Ltd which has dragged Rangoon makers to court over an uncanny resemblance between Kangana Ranaut's character, Julia, and Fearless Nadia, the pre-independence era Australian actress Mary Evans. Evans had taken up the screen name of Nadia, and had acted in many films like Hunterwali. Wadia lawyers Navroz Seervai and Priyanka Khimani had told the court that there were 19 similarities between their 1935  movie, Hunterwali, featuring Fearless Nadia, and Rangoon's trailer.On Monday, the court had asked both the parties to consider settling the issue, but none was ready to bow down. Senior advocate Virendra Tuljapurkar cited various judgements of Indian courts to show that copyright law does not cover a character. ""You cannot copyright a character. Under American laws it can be, but they are redundant in India as a copyright over a character does not exist.""Tuljapurkar also said that the character of Fearless Nadia was developed by Homi Wadia and his brother who wrote, directed and produced the films. ""It was later that a company was formed which took over the films. But in their own petition they say that they are still in the process of looking for the scripts and screenplays. So they themselves do not have the copyright. Do they have documents showing title, assignment that the author has given it to them?""Senior advocate Ravi Kadam, on behalf of Viacom 18 Motion Pictures, told the court that no film had the character of Fearless Nadia. The actress used to be called fearless as she used to do daring stunts herself. Moreover, Evans was one of the few actresses who started working in films when not many women dared to do so and that's why she was nicknamed Fearless Nadia. ""It's like calling Hema Malini, the dream girl. The actor has played many characters but she is known as dream girl. Now one cannot have a copyright over dream girl,"" said Kadam. He added that the film is set at the time of pre-independence era. ""No claim can be made around historical facts. Fearless Nadia is a historic figure,"" argued Kadam. He said the film is about a dancer Julia who is in love with the director played by Saif Ali Khan. She later goes to Burma where she meets a soldier played by Shahid Kapoor, who is working for the Indian National Army and is on a secret mission.Kadam accepted that the Rangoon makers were in talks with the Wadias for copyright on Fearless Nadia between 2006 and 2015. Emails showing the conversations between the two parties were perused by the petitioners. ""However when they said that the copyright is already been given to someone else it was not pursued any further,"" said Kadam."

""The kite farm would preferably be in Scotland and would generate enough power for 5,500 homes,"" said David Ainsworth, KPSs business development director. The kites are much cheaper than wind turbines as they use a lot less steel and are easier to transport and maintain, Ainsworth told The Times. "
"The US Air Force is negotiating with Boeing to purchase two 747-8 jetliners once built for Russian airline Transaero, which went bankrupt before the planes were delivered. The jetliners will be used as the new Air Force One and its backup. Air Force One is the aircraft that carries the President of the United States. ","Facing pressure from President Donald Trump to cut the cost of new Air Force One aircraft, the US Air Force is negotiating with Boeing to purchase two 747-8 jetliners that were built for a Russian airline that went bankrupt before they were delivered.?We?re working through the final stages of coordination to purchase two commercial 747-8 aircraft and expect to award a contract soon,? said Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek, who declined to elaborate on the details.National security publication Defense One, which first reported the negotiations, said the Air Force was believed to be getting a good deal on the aircraft, which sell for about $386 million on average.The two aircraft were initially ordered four years ago by Transaero, a Russian airline that went bankrupt in 2015, a person familiar with the talks told Reuters.Boeing built two 747-8s out of an order of four. But the airline never took ownership of them, and the planes have been stored in the Mojave Desert, where the dry, hot climate slows corrosion, Defense One said.Trump rattled Boeing in December before taking office by saying in a Twitter message: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg called Trump and told him the cost could be reduced if the Air Force changed its requirements, sources familiar with the conversation said at the time.White House officials in December were unclear where Trump obtained the $4 billion figure. The Air Force has estimated it would spend $2.87 billion through 2021 for development of a new presidential aircraft. The cost of refitting the commercial 747-8s with the enhanced electronics and security systems required for Air Force One were unclear.Boeing had said it expected to add the Air Force One jets to its backlog, which currently numbers 20 planes - five passenger models and 15 freighters.The redeployment to the Air Force of jets already built for another customer would effectively reduce Boeing?s future 747 production plans by two aircraft. But it would provide a home for two airframes that have been built but remain unsold.The Air Force operates two military versions of the Boeing 747-200B aircraft that serve as Air Force One when the president is aboard. Both are nearing the end of their planned 30-year life. "

""We also have our own culture. We will marry and divorce the way we want to. Nobody should direct us what we should do,"" Owaisi said.","All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi has urged Muslims to stand up in support of triple talaq, saying people of the community should draw inspiration from the way the Tamils fought against the ban on hugely popular bull-taming sport jallikattu. Owaisi said that like the Tamils, Muslims also have their own culture and they should derive inspiration from the Tamil protests which he said made even Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bow down. Owaisi added that nobody should interfere with their customs of marriage and triple talaq.""In Tamil Nadu, people protested in lakhs to fight for their tradition. Modi had to bow in front of them. Are we any less than them? We also have our own culture. We will marry and divorce the way we want to. Nobody should direct us what we should do,"" Owaisi said. Owaisi's statement has come at a time when the Supreme Court is looking into the constitutional validity of triple talaq after several women's groups challenged the practice.WHY THE CONTROVERSYWhile the Allahabad High Court termed triple talaq unconstitutional in December, 2016, the Supreme Court is separately hearing another plea filed by Saira Bano who has challenged the three rules related to Niqah (wedding). These rules are: Talaq-e-Bidat, Niqah Halala and a man's right to have four wives.TALAQ-E-BIDATTalaq-e-Bidat is the practice which gives a man the right to divorce to his wife by uttering 'talaq' three times without waiting for her consent on the matter.In the Islamic tradition, some conditions were imposed for Talaq-e-Bidat. A man can divorce his wife by uttering 'talaq' three times during the period of a Tuhar, that is, the time period of two menstruation cycles.This could be done in one sitting or spread over the specified period. Under Talaq-e-Bidat, the wife's consent is not required for the separation.NIQAH HALALAThere have been instances where men have uttered 'talaq' three times in an inebriated state or in a fit of rage and have later wanted to revert to normal married life. However, the practice of Niqah Halala prevents the reversal of the triple talaq.According to the practice of Niqah Halala, a man is not allowed to marry the same woman after divorce even if both the partners are willing. Such a niqah is considered haraam (illegal).Niqah Halala requires that the divorced woman marry some other man and after obtaining divorce from her second husband, she can remarry her first husband the second time.WATCH: Owaisi urges Muslims to fight for triple talaq the way Tamils fought for jallikattu"

Effigies of Rajinikanth were burnt in Tamil Nadu and protestors from pro-Tamilian groups including Thamizhar Munnetra Padai (TMP) termed him Kannadiga. The protests were in response to the actor hinting that he might join politics in a meeting with fans. TMP leader Veeralakshmi said Tamil political leaders were capable and the state doesn't need someone (referring to Rajinikanth) from Karnataka.,"Superstar Rajinikanth may have resorted back to his acting career and is leading a normal life after dropping hints to join politics, but all is not peaceful in Tamil Nadu. His May 19 speech was replete with hints of political ambition while the superstar met with his fans after a long time. But things have taken a drastic turn in Tamil Nadu politics since then. A day after Rajinikanth's speech, his effigy was burnt in Coimbatore by TPDK movement members claiming that he insulted Tamilians. But the next disaster was waiting to happen in Chennai.On May 22, another pro-Tamil group Thamizar Munnetra Padai decided to protest against Rajinikanth claiming him to be a Kannadiga. Veeralakshmi, the leader of the group announced a protest and that she would lay siege on Rajinikanth's house at Poes Garden. Security was beefed up and no vehicles were allowed beyond the checkpoints which were resurrected after Jayalalithaa's death.But to their surprise, Veeralakshmi brought her group near American Counsel and burnt the effigy of Rajinikanth. Embarrassed cops were unable to go near the effigy as it was packed with crackers, which is a new trend to make the police stop the protest. ""Down down, Kannadiga actor Rajnikanth. Tamil Nadu is only for Tamils,"" yelled Veeralakshmi while she held a flag near the burning effigy.The cops finally put out the fire, removed the effigy and arrested 17 members of the group. To everyone's surprise, not much outrage was seen in Chennai from Rajinikanth's fans.Yet around 4 pm in the evening, outraged Rajinikanth fans protested against Veeralakshmi and burnt her effigy at Madurai. Close to 50 Rajinikanth fans assembled near Periyar Bus stand and burnt Veeralakshmi's effigy raising slogans against anyone who opposed Rajinikanth's entry into politics.  The superstar has already cleared out that without someone opposing, you can't grow up in life and has asked his fans to lead their usual life until they hear the war cry.Also Read:Rajinikanth faces protest, pro-Tamil group calls him a Kannadiga, asks Thalaiva to stay out of politics Rajinikanth will join politics, for sure.

"The Bharatiya Janata Party in Delhi plans to launch a separate cell for young women between the age group of 18 to 25 years for the first time, according to reports. The independent 'Yuvti Prakoshth' (Young Women's Cell) will focus on those females who stay at home and are not politically active due to different reasons, the reports added.","With the aim to engage and mobilise young women in the age group of 18-25 years, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Delhi has planned to set up ?Yuvti Prakoshth? (Young Women?s Cell) for the first time. The proposed unit will not be the part of either Mahila Morcha (Women?s Wing) or Yuva Morcha (Youth Wing), and will work as an independent division. The decision has been taken following the directions of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). A party leader privy to the development said Ram Lal, national general secretary (organisation) of the BJP, had asked the state leadership to expand its base among young females, especially those who stay at home. ?While interacting with the state leadership during party president Amit Shah?s pravas (stay) in Delhi last week, Ram Lalji directed to bring young women to party fold. His view was that there are women who are impressed with party?s policies and ideology, but they don?t come out for different reasons. A special drive should be initiated to persuade them to join the party,? the leader said. Following Ram Lal?s instruction, state unit chief Manoj Tiwari has directed its Youth Wing (all 14 district presidents) to carry out an identification drive. ?The members of the Youth Wing have been asked to prepare a list of women in the age group of 18-25 years and are willing to work for the outfit. In the first phase, the district or block level leaders will prepare a list. Thereafter, a detailed strategy will be chalked out for further course of action. They are specifically been told that no pressure should be put on anyone, and to invite only those who are keen to join,? said a party insider. The BJP leaders, justifying the move, said the proposed cell will facilitate to tap a large section of the society, which generally remains ?unattended?. ?Female students mostly go to the Youth Wing and to work with the Mahila Morcha, one should be aged 25. Therefore, a significant number of women in the age group of 18-25 years are not actively involved in political activities. The party now plans to focus on this age group to strengthen the organisation further in the city,? he said."

The extra limb, which sits just behind Forrests left front leg, is slightly shorter than the other four so is not interfering with his mobility at the farm in Ashbourne. "
"Indian tennis player Sania Mirza's former women's doubles partner Switzerland's Martina Hingis won the Wimbledon mixed doubles title alongside Andy Murray's brother Jamie Murray on Sunday. The British-Swiss duo defeated defending champions Heather Watson and Henri Kontinen. This was Murray's fourth Grand Slam title, while Hingis registered her 23rd Grand Slam title triumph.","Jamie Murray ensured the family name will be on a Wimbledon trophy for the third time in five years as he and the former world No1 Martina Hingis beat the defending champions Heather Watson and Henri Kontinen of Finland 6-4, 6-4 to win the mixed doubles crown.After the painful end to Andy Murray?s title defence, it was left to Jamie to produce the goods and he and Hingis, the No1 seeds, duly clinched victory in 74 minutes.?I have to thank Martina for asking me as I wasn?t going to play mixed doubles,? Murray said. ?When she texted me, it was an easy decision to play, she?s such a great player. Anyone in the locker room would have jumped at the chance to play with her. I really enjoyed the whole week. It?s a great achievement. Any time you win a grand slam, get your name up on the board again, it?s there forever. No one will take it away from you.?Andy Murray, notoriously nervous when watching his brother play, was lurking in the locker room during the match but was there to congratulate him soon after he came off court. ?I just saw him there,? Jamie said. ?He said he came in the middle of the first set. I think he just waited in the lockers. He said he didn?t watch it. I don?t know if he snuck a few points in or not.?With Murray and Watson on opposite sides of the net, it was a win-win situation for British fans on Centre Court, most of whom had stuck around after seeing Roger Federer clinch a record eighth singles title earlier in the day. And they were rewarded with a match full of power, angles, deft volleys and outstanding movement around the net, especially from Murray, whose net skills left the crowd gasping at times.Hingis was the runner-up to Kontinen and Watson last year alongside Leander Paes but when she dumped the Indian in favour of Murray, the Scot knew he had a great chance to add to his grand slam tally. Ten years after partnering Jelena Jankovic to victory here, this was his fourth grand slam crown in all while Hingis took her total to 23, five singles, 12 women?s doubles and six mixed, five of which have come since the beginning of 2015.The big-hitting Kontinen, the men?s doubles world No1, had his moments and Watson held her own but last year?s champions were always up against it with Hingis?s dipping returns perfectly complementing Murray?s sharp net play. After trading early breaks, Watson was broken for the second time at 3-3 and they closed out the opening set.Kontinen and Watson had two chances to break the Murray serve at 3-2 up in the second set but could not take them. A slightly mis-hit return from Hingis set up two break points for the top seeds on the Watson serve at 3-3 and they took the second to get the vital break as Watson hit a forehand into the net. After Hingis held to love, the pair saved three break points to serve out for the title.Kontinen said he and Watson had not taken their chances but they hope to team up again next year. Murray and Hingis have yet to discuss future plans but it seems likely they will defend their title next summer and they may even play together in the US Open later this summer.Hingis, who won the singles here 20 years ago, admitted she was ?not used to no? when she asks someone to play mixed doubles. ?Here, it?s always tough,? she said. ?I understand in the past guys would have said no because they really want to focus on doubles only because it?s three?out-of-five [sets]. This is the only tournament that still does it. It?s definitely easier to ask somebody at the other three grand slams and not Wimbledon. But I was definitely hoping for a yes.?As Jamie said: ?It was a good decision by both of us.?"

I acknowledge very clearly, but have we given them proper sanctity or not?"" Prasad asked at the Mindmine Summit here. He was responding to a question related to development having an impact on culture and diversity. ""We salute diversity and culture of India. There are two ways of looking at it. Let me be very frank today. There has been campaign against us for a very long time, but today we are here because of blessings of people of India,"" Prasad said. In recent Assembly elections, the BJP scored an impressive win in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The party also formed government in Goa and Manipur. Its main rival Congress was able to get a clear majority in Punjab only. As IT minister, Prasad said, he has visited many Muslim-dominated villages where many Muslim youth are running Common Service Centres which help people avail of government services through Internet. The minister cited the example of Prime Minister Narendra Modi short-listing a Muslim tea garden labourer in Jalpaiguri, Karimul Haque, for his exemplary work. Prasad said Haque has converted his motorcycle into an ambulance, rushes whosoever falls sick to hospital and in the process, has saved nearly 2,000 lives. ""We never saw religion of Haque or whether he voted for us or not. If there are certain uncalled for voices, the Prime Minister addresses the concerns, the CMs (chief ministers) address concerns. Yogi (Adityanath) is a popular leader. You are seeing his instances of good governance and inclusive development,"" Prasad said. The minister said he has issues with those in the Left and journalists spreading ""hatred"" against Modi. ""We have a problem with some of our friends. Mostly, the Leftist friends and journalists who entertain a pathological hatred against Narendra Modi. Good luck to them,"" Prasad quipped. According to Prasad, the Left is ""left out"" all over the world and had been defeated in India. ""They are left out in Bengal, are surviving in Kerala and Tripura, but the Left has got a very good campus in Delhi, which is the JNU (Jawaharlal Nehru University) and I always say the Left also needs some consolation prize. So, JNU is their consolation prize, we dont mind that,"" Prasad said. "

"A Chinese spy ship was spotted off the coast of Queensland during a joint war exercise between Australian and US forces, the Australian Defence Force (ADF) said on Saturday. Adding that the spy ship remained outside Australia's territorial waters and did not interfere with the operation, ADF said that the ship did enter the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone.","A Chinese spy ship has been spotted off the coast of Queensland during a joint training exercise between Australian and US forces, the defence department has confirmed.The Type 815 Auxiliary General Intelligence (AGI) vessel was sighted during war games, known as Exercise Talisman Sabre, and defence officials told the ABC?s AM program it was a ?provocative move?.

"Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman PJ Kurien on Thursday said airlines have no authority to impose a flying ban on anybody, including parliamentarians. The remark came in response to the issue raised by MP Naresh Agrawal about the recent bans on parliamentarians. If any MP does something against the law, the law of the land should take its course, Kurien added.","Airlines have no authority to impose flying ban on anybody, including parliamentarians, and the law of the land should take its course, Rajya Sabha deputy chairman PJ Kurien said on Thursday.The remarks came after SP member Naresh Agrawal raised the issue of recent flying ban imposed by major domestic airlines, including state-owned Air India.Agrawal wanted to know if the airlines could impose such restrictions. According to him, such an action was a breach of privilege of the Members of Parliament.To this, Kurien said agreed that Agrawal has raised a ?valid point? that if any MP has committed a crime or something against the law, the law of the land should take its course.?Airlines are not given the authority to punish anybody. I think the government should take note of it.?MPs are also citizens ... if they commit a crime or mistake, the law of the land should take recourse to it,? the deputy chairman said.He further said ?it is a punishment imposed on an MP for some crime...This cannot be done. This is not a thing to be punished by airlines?.Congress MP Anand Sharma suggested to the deputy chairman that the word ?crime? should be replaced with ?violation?.However, Kurien said if a person beats up someone, it is a crime.Different airlines on Wednesday lifted the flying ban on TDP lawmaker JC Diwakar Reddy after ?urgent? notices from the court to the government and the aviation regulator DGCA on the lawmaker?s plea against the action of domestic carriers.On June 15, Reddy got into a verbal spat with IndiGo ground staff at Visakhapatnam airport and threw a printer kept at the airline counter after he was informed that boarding for his flight to Hyderabad had closed.Reddy was the second MP after Shiv Sena?s Ravindra Gaikwad who was banned from flying domestic airlines. A flying ban was imposed on Gaikwad in March this year after he repeatedly hit an Air India officer with slippers for not providing him a business class seat on an all-economy flight.The ban was lifted after a fortnight following an undertaking from him that he would desist from such conduct in future.

The Android Nougat 7.1.2 update brings with a number of bug fixes and improvements targeted at the two Pixel smartphones in particular. A number of problems such as the early shutdown issue, audio cracking issue and the issue of pink banding seen on the camera have been resolved.However, the 7.1.2 update has brought with it an altogether new problem for Pixel owners. The update is reportedly disabling the fingerprint scanner in some Pixel and Pixel XL devices. Many users have taken to the Google Product forums to complain about the same. It has to be kept in mind that not all users are experiencing the problem. If you have a Pixel smartphone, there is a chance you might not experience this issue at all after updating.

Even deleting your configured fingerprints does not work as then the device does not allow you to add any new fingerprints.If you are facing the issue, the only option at this time seems to be to wait for Google to issue an update or try to revert back to Android 7.1.1 Nougat if you can. It seems some Pixel and Nexus owners will have to make do with traditional means of unlocking the smartphone till a fix is issued.The latest iteration of Android Nougat is now also rolling out to Nexus 6P users enrolled in Google's Android Beta program.

"In a first, US-based scientists claim to have developed a vaccine for chikungunya fever from an insect-specific virus that does not affect people. Scientists used an Eilat virus clone to design a hybrid virus-based vaccine, which is structurally identical to the natural chikungunya virus. The hybrid virus can replicate in mosquitoes, but not in mammals.","Houston, Dec 20 (PTI) Scientists have developed the first vaccine for chikungunya fever made from an insect-specific virus that does not have any effect on people, making it safe and effective. The newly developed vaccine quickly produces a strong immune defence and completely protects mice and nonhuman primates from disease when exposed to the chikungunya virus, researchers said. ""This vaccine offers efficient, safe and affordable protection against chikungunya and builds the foundation for using viruses that only infect insects to develop vaccines against other insect-borne diseases,"" said Scott Weaver, professor at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) in the US. Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne virus that causes a disease characterised by fever and severe joint pain, often in hands and feet, and may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, or rash. Some patients will feel better within a week but many develop longer-term joint pain that can last up to years. Death is rare but can occur, researchers said. Traditionally, vaccine development involves trade-offs between how quickly the vaccine works and safety. Live-attenuated vaccines that are made from weakened versions of a live pathogen typically offer rapid and durable immunity but reduced safety. On the other hand, the inability of inactivated vaccines to replicate enhances safety at the expense of effectiveness, often requiring several doses and boosters to work properly. There may be a risk of disease with both of these vaccine types, either from incomplete inactivation of the virus or from incomplete or unstable weakening of the live virus that is only recognised when rare vulnerable individuals develop disease. To overcome these trade-offs, the researchers used the Eilat virus as a vaccine platform since it only infects insects and has no impact on people. The UTMB researchers used an Eilat virus clone to design a hybrid virus-based vaccine containing chikungunya structural proteins. The Eilat/Chikungunya vaccine was found to be structurally identical to natural chikungunya virus. The difference is that although the hybrid virus replicates very well in mosquito cells, it cannot replicate in mammals. "
"Chelsea and England legend Frank Lampard ended his 21-year professional football career after announcing his retirement on Thursday. The 38-year-old, who scored a club-record 211 goals for Chelsea, won a Champions League title alongside winning three Premier League titles with the Blues. The midfielder won 106 caps for England and scored over 300 goals in his career.","It is a moment that is seared on to the consciousness of Frank Lampard and every Chelsea fan ? particularly those who were there. Bolton Wanderers away; 30 April 2005. Lampard surges around one opponent, cuts inside another and thrashes a low shot into the net.If Chelsea win, they win the league title. For the first time since 1955. And in their centenary year, too. Lampard has set them on their way and the celebrations that follow are frenzied. He is buried beneath a scrum of team-mates. Even some of the substitutes jump on.Lampard is not finished. On a quick break, he finds himself one-on-one with the goalkeeper. He walks the ball around him to make it 2-0. Game over. Chelsea are the champions. Lampard is a champion. Not bad for a player who they said would not make it to the top.He was not finished. It was the second major honour of his career, following on from the League Cup triumph in February of that year and Lampard would go on to claim 11 of them ? all with his beloved Chelsea, the club he joined from West Ham United in 2001. The highlight, surely, was the Champions League final in 2012, when he captained Chelsea, in the absence of the suspended John Terry, to the penalty shootout victory against Bayern Munich.Now, Lampard is finished. At the age of 38 and after 21 years in the professional game, he has decided to retire. He does so with three Premier League titles to his name; four FA Cups; two League Cups; the Champions League and the Europa League. In other words, the clean sweep at club level.With England, it never went to plan, although he is hardly the only player who can say that. He was excellent at Euro 2004, scoring three times as England reached the quarter-finals but his subsequent tournament appearances at the World Cups of 2006, 2010 and 2014 were disappointments.Lampard missed his penalty in the quarter-final shootout defeat against Portugal in 2006 and, four years later, his glorious shot in the last 16 against Germany bounced off the crossbar and over the line ? except that the officials ruled it as no goal. It would have made the score 2-2. Instead, England slumped to a 4-1 defeat.In many respects, it summed up how Lampard?s international career, which yielded 106 caps and 29 goals, came down on the wrong side of the margins. It was shaped by his relationship in central midfield with Steven Gerrard, or the lack of one. The Lampard-Gerrard conundrum was debated endlessly.Nevertheless, Lampard goes down as a Premier League great and he owes it all to his phenomenal work ethic and mental toughness; the desire that he has always had to prove his worth ? and others wrong.?When Frank was a youngster, I can remember a lot of people saying: ?What?s all the fuss? He?s a good player but he isn?t that good,? says Tony Carr, the former West Ham academy director, under whom Lampard developed. ?He never got to play for England schoolboys and I can remember Harry Redknapp, the West Ham manager, asking me why Frank wasn?t playing for England youth, when he was a youth-team player at the club.?Harry rang the England coach, who was Dave Burnside, and Dave said: ?We know about him but we think we?ve got better.? That sort of thing was a fantastic spur for Frank. With his bloody?mindedness, his dedication, the way he constantly tried to improve himself ? he made himself the ultimate pro. I?ve got nothing but complete admiration for him.?As the tributes came in on Thursday, the one from Terry stood out. Lampard?s long-time Chelsea team?mate described him as a gentleman and a leader. But Terry also made reference to how Lampard had wrung every last drop from his talent. ?You were the best trainer by a million miles every single day, inspiring me and everyone at the club,? Terry wrote. ?You stayed out [after training] working on your finishing ? 20 goals a year wasn?t good enough for you; you wanted 25, 30 goals. I will miss you getting four cones and doing sprints after training ? setting the example for the academy kids.?Lampard is synonymous with consistency and durability; only Ryan Giggs and Gareth Barry have made more Premier League appearances than his 609 while his run of 164 consecutive matches remains a record for an outfield player. He read the game with intelligence ? this is a man who recorded one of Britain?s highest Mensa scores ? and it is questionable whether he got the credit he deserves for his exceptional short and long passing.In the end, though, Lampard was defined by his goals; the timing of the runs, the technique and the power of the execution. He says the two at Bolton were his best with the one he scored for Chelsea at Aston Villa in 2013, which took him past Bobby Tambling?s all-time record for the club, not far behind.When Lampard left Chelsea in 2014 to finish his career at Manchester City and New York City, he did so with 211 goals from 649 appearances for them. It is doubtful whether the mark will be overhauled. In terms of the Premier League, only Alan Shearer, Wayne Rooney and Andy Cole have scored more than his 177 goals and they, of course, are strikers.His numbers are mind?boggling and Terry, Tambling and others have described him as Chelsea?s greatest player. His next move looks likely to be into coaching. Whatever he does, Lampard will give it his all."

In a jibe aimed at the Sena which has been ruling the Mumbai civic body for over two decades now, Rane said, ""Cities like Singapore, Shanghai and Kuala Lumpur rose to fame as the world class cities only in the last 25 to 30 years. But Mumbai, which came into existence 152 years ago, has not been able to progress into a world class city"". Rane, who had served as a corporator early in his political career, said had the contemporary corporators been learned enough, they would not have allowed the BMC Commissioner to cut the capital expenditure in the annual civic budget. ""The surplus funds lying with the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) and the Rs 60,000 crore of the BMC that are lying in Fixed Deposits with the banks should be used to make Mumbai a world class city,"" Rane said. In order to develop Mumbai into a truly global city, the government should appoint an agency, give them three months time, he said, adding that World Bank, the Centre and the state governments could create a fund for the development of civic infrastructure. Despite contributing 25 to 30 per cent by way of tax to the Central kitty, Mumbais condition continues to be pathetic, he added. In an apparent reference to Sena president Uddhav Thackerays remarks suggesting that the BMC was helpless when it rains heavily in Mumbai, Rane said even if it rains 400 mm in a day, Central Mumbai gets water logged. ""Some parts of Mumbai are below the sea level. But why no steps have been taken to improve sewerage system and pumping stations?"" he asked. Taking potshots at Sena over its recent stand-off with RJ Malishka Mendonsa who mocked the civic body on various issues through a video, Rane said Mumbai is a 152-year-old city and over the years, new unbelievable technological innovations have been made.

"Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal has said the government's proposal to auction spectrum every year whether industry needs it or not is ""very progressive thought"". ""In fact, it will become a leading edge practice worldwide,"" Mittal added. Earlier, Telecom Secretary JS Deepak said the government is looking to make spectrum auction an annual event and will seek TRAI's recommendations.","From Prasoon Srivastava Barcelona, Mar 2 (PTI) The governments proposal to auction spectrum every year has got a backer in Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal, who however has said there is no need for sale of airwaves in coming fiscal. ""The way he (telecom secretary) has put it that spectrum auction will be done every year whether industry needs it or not is very progressive thought. In fact, it will become a leading edge practice worldwide,"" Mittal told PTI in an interview. J S Deepak, as the Telecom Secretary, a couple of days ago said the government is looking at making spectrum auction an annual event and will reach out to sector regulator Trai for its recommendations. He had said the government plans to provide industry with an option to buy spectrum every year irrespective of their interest so that there is never a shortage of spectrum in providing quality mobile services. Deepak, a 1982-batch IAS officer from Uttar Pradesh, who at present is at the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona, has been shifted with ""immediate effect"" from the telecom ministry and made officer on special duty in the commerce department. Mittal recently pitched for affordability in spectrum pricing that has gone ""out of control"" in the last few years, saying the spectrum surplus industry will not need an airwave auction at least in 2017-18. He, however, has said that even though telecom operators are bleeding with the entrance of a new service provider, they will need to increase investment in networks to handle competition. ""You have to accelerate market spends. You need to put more capex. We have done 85,000 base stations last year, 80,000 base stations this year. This is largest rollout anywhere in the world. There will be more investment on 4G side,"" Mittal said. Bharti Airtel had reported an over 54 per cent fall in net profit at Rs 503.7 crore for the December quarter due to what it had termed as ""turbulence from predatory pricing by a new operator"". The Indian telecom czar said Bharti Airtels balancesheet remains ""healthy and strong"" and he does not think Bharti will go into losses under competitive pressure although one can ""never say never"". He maintained that with improvement in technology, the cost of network is not linear. Mittal further said Huawei and ZTE have a massive mimo technology using which one can quadruple or probably go up to 8 times of existing capacities in the spectrum. ""Nice good innovation is happening on the network side where you can generate nice good capacities than in the past. Technology is also coming to help. Its not that if I have got 2000 TB of capacity and I have to move to 5000, I have to double my investments. Its probably 20 per cent more,"" Mittal said. "

Although Chief Justice Chellur did not believe this situation was due to the strike but the government pleader, appearing for the state government, told the court that the health care in civic and state-run hospitals was paralysed due to 60 per cent of its workforce not reporting to work.Advocate Prashant Pophale appearing for the Maharashtra Association for Resident Doctors (MARD) pointed out that there have been three incidents wherein patients' relatives have beaten up doctors in Dhule, Mumbai (Sion Hospital) and Nashik in the last few days.WHY THE PUBLIC ANARCHY, ASKS CHIEF JUSTICE CHELLUR Chief Justice Chellur asked, ""Why the public anarchy? It's madness,"" before asking the state pleader to explain the reason for the such action taken by the patients' relatives. She added, ""I don't say doctors don't commit mistakes but, there are complications due to which patients lose their life. Every case cannot be due to negligence. And even if there is negligence there are redressal forums for it.""Pophale pointed out to the court that the doctors are not on strike but only on mass leave and as an association, they have been telling the doctors not to do so. He, however, added that the state has done little to protect the doctors. But Chief Justice Chellur was of the opinion that the resident doctors cannot put the public at large in trouble. ""If you (resident doctors) think being a doctor you can behave like a factory worker, then you are unfit to serve as a doctor. It's a shame. How can you (resident doctors) say first provide security only then we will work?"" asked Chief Justice Chellur.NEXT HEARING TOMORROWWith this, the Bombay High Court ordered the striking resident doctors to join work or face action by the management. It said that the management is free to initiate action and contempt proceedings against the striking doctors. The next hearing of the case is on March 22.After the Bombay High Court issued the order, Naresh Kabra, a resident doctor at Sion Hospital present at the hearing, said, ""We are not super humans either. Patients verbally abuse us almost every day but we don't say anything. It's only when we are physically beaten up that we have protested. Why cannot the state protect us?""

"Indian para-swimmer Kanchanmala Pande, who is completely blind, won a silver at the Para Swimming Championships in Germany after borrowing money to participate. Kanchanmala, who took a loan of ?5 lakh after money sanctioned by the government did not reach her, also qualified for the World Championships with the win. She paid the accommodation and visa expenses on her own.","As a para-athlete, Kanchanmala Pande knows well how to swim against the tide. But this time, she was left high and dry by India's sports authorities.Nagpur-based Kanchanmala, who is completely sightless and swims in the S11 category, had to face extreme misery during her trip to Berlin because of alleged slip-ups by the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI).She and five others participating in the Para Swimming Championships in the German capital from July 3-9 had a harrowing time as the government money sanctioned for their tour did not reach them.In the end, Kanchanmala had to beg and borrow money in an unfamiliar city. The PCI, however, has blamed the Sports Authority of India for the lapse.But the situation failed to deter the athletes' fierce determination. Despite all odds, Kanchanmala and Suyash Jadhav won silver medals and qualified for the World Championships.Kanchanmala, 26, beat the qualifying mark in 100m Freestyle (1:34:00), 100m Backstroke (1:41:00), 100m Breaststroke (2:01:00) and 200m Individual Medley (3:03:00), in which she also picked up a silver medal. She became the only female swimmer from India to qualify for the World Para Swimming Championships this year.The sportspersons have been inspired by India's remarkable show at the Rio Paralympics last year, where the country posted its best-ever performance by winning two golds, a silver and a bronze.'NEVER THOUGHT WOULD FACE SUCH PROBLEMS'Kanchanmala and her escort Jaimala Pande were part of the Berlin contingent that was granted sponsorship by the government. However, the PCI failed to provide her the money and she was forced to bear her hotel and food expenses.""I never thought I would face such problems. I had to take a loan of Rs 5 lakh so that I could participate in the tournament. I had to qualify for the World Championships and I don't know why PCI didn't understand its importance,"" Kanchamala, who is also an assistant with the Reserve Bank of India in Nagpur, told Mail Today.""I was not given any official confirmation if I will receive a reimbursement for the expense I bore. I had to pay around Rs 70,000 for the hotel and more than Rs 40,000 for food. There was a time when I had no money left. I was simply devastated. Moreover, they put my name in 50m Backstroke when it was never my event. I had to write letters to the International Paralympic Committee when a coach was appointed to take care of the swimmers.""The swimmers were also asked to arrange their visas, which cost her additional Rs 15,000. To add to the misery, Kanchanmala, who won a bronze at the 2011 World Para Games, was shocked to see that the PCI had registered her in the 50m Backstroke event when she had actually applied for the 100m Backstroke.'HORROR SHOW'In her own words, Kanchanmala's Europe trip was no less than a ""horror show"". The coach Kanchanmala refers to is Kanwaljeet Singh, the man sent by the PCI to assist the para-swimmers.Singh was allegedly of almost no help, often going missing during the main events while also going to the extent of asking for 90 pounds (Rs 7,462) as participation fee.""He (Singh) didn't help me at all. I used to go back to the hotel just with my escort and god knows where he used to be. Once, I took a tram from the tournament venue to my hotel and I had no money. I had to travel without ticket and was caught by the checker who later fined me 120 pounds (about Rs 10,000),"" Kanchanmala said.""He (Singh) asked for participation fee from me when it should be PCI paying for all of this. Even though he paid the fee later, I had a very rough time with him. A coach should be helpful and always take care of athletes. I didn't see any of that.""BLAME GAMEHowever, PCI vice-president Gurucharan Singh maintained that the Sports Authority of India (SAI) had not sanctioned the amount for the tournament while also saying that the swimmers will be refunded their money.""We are facing problems from with SAI regarding sanction of amount for championships. The money for swimming championship in Berlin didn't come on time and as the process takes around 3-4 days, we weren't able to provide it to the swimmers,"" he said.""I am here in London for the World Athletics Championship and we are also facing a problem of shortage of money. SAI sanctioned just 40,000 pounds (Rs 33.16 lakh) while the organisers are asking for 80,000 pounds (Rs 66.32 lakh). We will hold meetings with SAI officials to discuss this matter. So, a fix to all this will be done once the London meet is over. I assure you, the swimmers will be given back their money. As for the coach problem, I am not aware of it. As soon as I get back to India, we will talk to the swimmers and will carry out an inquiry if needed.""Despite the frustrations, Kanchanmala fulfilled her dream to qualify for her second World Championship and wants to put all this behind as she aims for more glory in the September meet."
'Titanic' actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are auctioning off a dinner with the two of them at the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation's fourth annual gala on Wednesday for charity.

"According to reports, actor Shahid Kapoor wanted to be called a 'superstar' and not a 'star' by a magazine for which he did a photoshoot. Shahid reportedly said if the magazine team didn't want to make the change, he wanted the entire story removed. The team made the change but later altered the title following the release of 'Rangoon'.","Is Shahid Kapoor a star or a superstar? The answer to that depends on whether you are a 'Shanatic' or not. Well, Shahid himself thought he was a superstar but unfortunately, the editor of a popular film magazine had to disagree.According to Rajeev Masand's latest column in Open Magazine, it all began when Shahid Kapoor did a photoshoot for the cover of a 'popular film glossy' a few days before the release of his film Rangoon. The issue was supposed to hit the stands a couple of weeks after the film's release.When the magazine's team sent Shahid a scan of the feature story, before the issue was sent to the press for printing, Shahid apparently 'balked', according to the magazine's editor. Shahid, reportedly, did not like being called a 'star' in the story's headline and demanded that 'star' should be changed to 'superstar'. Shahid said that if the magazine team did not want to make the change, he wanted the entire story 'pulled'.Consequently, the magazine team made the required change and the edition was sent to the press for printing.But Rangoon finally released and flopped big time. The magazine's editor reportedly 'felt silly for indulging the actor's whims' and immediately ensured that the issue was called back in time so that the headline could be changed again. So, the new headline focused on Shahid Kapoor recently becoming a father."

"The World Bank on Wednesday decelerated India's GDP growth forecast for FY 2016-17 to 7% from its previous estimate of 7.6% due to demonetisation. ""The challenges encountered in phasing out large currency notes and replacing them with new ones may pose risks to the pace of other economic reforms (eg Goods and Services Tax, labour, and land reforms),"" it said.","The World Bank has downgraded the Indian economy?s growth forecast as sharp falls in the country?s automobile and real estate sales flagged the short-term impact of recalling India?s two most-used bank notes. The Washington-based financial institution predicted India?s economy would grow by a ?still robust? 7% in the fiscal year to March 2017 ? a 0.6% drop from its earlier forecast but still the fastest rate of any major economy in the world.It attributes the fall to November?s decision to recall all 1,000 and 500 rupee currency bills from circulation, a surprise demonetisation move intended to weed out untaxed wealth, hasten the digitisation of India?s economy and disrupt terrorist and other criminal networks. ?Continued tailwinds from low oil prices and solid agricultural output [were] partly offset by challenges associated with the withdrawal of a large volume of currency in circulation and subsequent replacement with new notes,? the World Bank said on Wednesday.Demonetisation has suffocated the vast informal economy, which employs up to 80% of Indians, but the World Bank said the impact of the policy was likely to be short term. ?India is expected to regain its momentum, with growth rising to 7.6% in fiscal year 2018-19 and strengthening to 7.8% in fiscal year 2019-20,? the bank said.Automobile industry data also released on Wednesday showed the largest fall in sales in 16 years. Nearly 300,000 fewer vehicle were purchased last month than in December 2015, a drop of 19%, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.Sales of two-wheelers ? which require less paperwork to buy and are more popular in rural areas, so are more likely to be bought in cash ? fell by 22%, the steepest rate since Siam began collecting data in 1997.Property sales also came to a complete standstill, according to a report by property consultants Knight Frank India. Sales fell by 44% across eight major Indian cities between October and December 2016, compared with the same period in 2015, the report said.Delhi was particularly badly hit, with sales in the capital slumping by more than 50%, and 73% fewer new residential developments being launched than in the last quarter of 2015. ?The effect of demonetisation on all segments of the real estate sector across all markets has been fairly brutal to say the least,? said Shishir Baijal, the chairman of Knight Frank India.Speaking at the Vibrant Gujarat summit on Wednesday, the Indian finance minister, Arun Jaitley, continued to defend demonetisation, linking the policy to the goods and services tax the government is aiming to introduce in April. ?The combination of a more digitised economy with a more efficient tax system ... will make our economy look much cleaner and bigger,? he said.Jaitley said the rupee recall was ?a major step toward integration of [the] informal economy with the more formal economy?. He said: ?This itself is going to increase the transactions which are covered within the banking system, transactions which may lead to higher [tax] revenue in the future.?"

At Gargi College, 39 students have made it to the first admissions list.Students who may not have made it to the ECA admissions list in the first round, have another four more rounds to go.?All seats will not necessarily be filled by the end of the first cycle, as the same student may have made it to the list of multiple colleges, but would seek admission only at one. So a second cycle of admission will start on July 18, which will follow a similar schedule. There will be five such admission cycles, and students will need to re-register under each cycle, if they wish to be considered for admission under that session,?

"The Delhi Division of Indian Railways is developing green patches around railway stations in the capital. An initiative under the Swachh Bharat Mission, the vacant area near railway tracks is also being covered with shrubs and flowers. Delhi Divisional Railway Manager Arun Arora said that the initiative has been inspired by the South Beijing railway station in China. ","The heaps of garbage, unpleasant sight of open defecation and the 'lewd' graffiti on the walls as trains move slowly onto the Delhi region will be a thing of past now. Taking a cue from the 'green' South Beijing railway station, the Delhi Division of Indian Railway has begun developing green patches surrounding railway stations in Delhi.The vacant rail land and the railway yards too will be covered with ornamental plants and shrubs to give it a pleasant look.Also read: #BudgetAajTak: Indian Railways working on Mission Zero Accident, says Manoj SinhaAccording to railway officials, encroachment on railway land is the biggest hurdle in keeping the railway lines clean.

The plan is a major initiative under the flagship 'Swachh Bharat Mission'. The contract has been placed and work has started at New Delhi station, which is expected to show results by end of April 2017, an official said.THE TWO PHASE PLANTo begin with, railway yards at New Delhi, Old Delhi and Hazrat Nizamuddin stations will be taken up. The plan is being developed in two phases. Many special drives were launched in last one year to clean up the garbage spread along the tracks approaching Delhi, but they failed to yield desired result.""We managed to maintain cleanliness in some parts while those located close to big Jhhugi clusters remained filthy. Garbage was found to be accumulated again after a few days of the drive in areas near slums,"" Arora said."

"With majority of toilets built under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan lying unused, posters depicting characters like Baahubali making their contribution towards cleanliness have been put up to push the campaign at Indian Railways.

From national icons like Mahatma Gandhi, BR Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh to present-day heroes like Baahubali, the module uses these characters to urge people to stop littering and defecating in public.A pilot project has been launched by a behavioural intervention startup, Antyodaya Group at the New Delhi railway station which uses behavioural science to communicate the message. Posters and hoardings have been put up at the station appealing passengers to be like Gandhi, Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh by keeping the country clean.TOILET INFRASTRUCTURE""The Swachh Bharat Mission is mostly confined to create toilet infrastructure but little has been done to change the mindset of people towards using these facilities. As a result, the infrastructure largely remains unused.

"Indian Cellular Association President Pankaj Mohindroo on Wednesday said that India is probably the worst country to do business in. He criticised India's business climate saying cumbersome processes have emerged out of distrust between tax officials and customs authorities. He further said that lack of ease of doing business is very upsetting to the industry.
","New Delhi, Aug 2 (PTI) Mobile industry body Indian Cellular Association (ICA) today criticised the business climate in India saying cumbersome processes have emerged out of distrust between tax officials and customs authorities. ""Ease of doing business...there are very few countries we can compete with, obviously from the bottom. Probably, this is the worst country to do business in. That is a very frank statement I want to make,"" ICA National President Pankaj Mohindroo said at an event organised by IAMAI. He said that IGCR (Import of goods at concessional rate of duty for manufacture of excisable goods) processes are very cumbersome in the country. ""There is no trust between customs authorities and taxation authorities. Most ridiculous thing that I have ever heard is that there is target given for revenue collection,"" Mohindroo said. He said that lack of ease of doing business is very upsetting to the industry. Industry players raised concerns over huge capital getting blocked in bank guarantees given as assurance to customs that the items imported by them on concessional duty rates will not be retailed in the market and will be used solely for making mobile phones. As per data available in April, it is estimated that bank guarantees to the tune of Rs 29,000 crore have been furnished by companies. Ajay Kumar, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and IT who was present at the event, countered Mohindroos claim saying that there has been continuous improvement when it comes to doing business in India. ""India has jumped up several position in global indices released on ease of doing business. Now, government gives 30 clearances in one day on e-biz portal for which people were required to approach similar number of offices. Ease of doing business is a continuous improvement process and India is on right track,"" Kumar said. The Fast Track Task Force, a joint government and industry body, has an objective to achieve production target of 500 million mobile phones by 2019 and generate employment for 15 lakh by 2019. Mohindroo, who heads the task force, said the target can be achieved only if India is able to match competitors like China and Vietnam. ""China today is around 82 per cent of global manufacturing, which means it produces 20 lakh mobile phones per year. We are very elated that (mobile production) in India has reached Rs 90,000 crore, Vietnam is already at 3 lakh crore. We have to match them in terms of direct taxes what Vietnam and China are able to give,"" Mohindroo said. He said that direct tax in China in special cases is around 10 per cent while in Vietnam it is nearly zero. Mohindroo said exports will play key role to achieve the target set by 500 million mobile phones production in India. ""Pakistan does not permit Indian mobile phones to enter Pakistan, which is closest biggest market, and we have given most favoured nation to Pakistan. This is not fair. I think Commerce Ministry has to take a lot of lead in this. Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, also dont give us any credits,"" he said. "

"The Maharashtra government has launched a scheme to cover medical insurance of up to ?10 lakh of 335 sitting legislators, 837 former legislators, and their families. This is reportedly aimed at curbing the use of fake bills in the medical reimbursement scheme the legislators were covered under earlier. The insurance scheme will cost the state almost ?10 crore a year. ","The Maharashtra government has decided to give free medical insurance cover of up to Rs10 lakh to all sitting and former legislators and their families. The government will have to set aside Rs9.96 crore a year to pay the insurance premiums of 335 sitting legislators and 837 former legislators ? 1,172 in all. Each premium works out to Rs85,000.Legislators were earlier covered by the government?s medical reimbursement scheme. A committee headed by top medical officials would examine and approve medical bills submitted by legislators. The annual expenditure on such reimbursements was about Rs9crore to Rs10 crore. Under the new scheme, six of a family, regardless of their age and medical condition, are collectively entitled to an insurance cover of up to Rs10 lakh. If the cover is exhausted, the policy has a contingency provision of Rs10 crore for all legislators. Family members of legislators won?t have to undergo any medical tests, said an official. Chief minster Devendra Fadnavis took the decision three weeks ago, said the official.Earlier, the government had proposed an annual insurance cover of Rs15 lakh for each legislator. This would have increased the state?s financial burden by Rs4 crore. With the insurance scheme, the government expects to curb the use of fake bills for reimbursements. ?In many cases, we found that legislators had submitted fake and duplicate bills to claim medical reimbursement,? said an official from the finance department. Officials who clear medical bills said the insurance scheme would be better than the existing one. ?We have a network of 4,700 hospitals across the country under the insurance scheme. It will be a cashless facility and the insured members will not have to pay from their pockets. The reimbursement scheme covered only five critical and 27 serious diseases,? he added.READMaharashtra lawmakers get monthly salary hike with immediate effectMaharashtra govt releases ?894 crore as crop insurance for farmers"

"The adoption of GST could help raise India's medium-term GDP growth to over 8% and create a single national market for enhancing the efficiency of the movement of goods and services, IMF has said. Further, IMF said that the implementation of a robust GST regime should be a key priority for the country, given its growth-enhancing effects.","From Lalit K Jha Washington, Feb 22 (PTI) The adoption of the GST could help raise Indias medium-term GDP growth to over eight per cent and create a single national market for enhancing the efficiency of the movement of goods and services, the IMF said today. At the same time, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also expressed concerns over the implementation of the Goods and Service Tax (GST). ""Although some uncertainties remain around the design and pace of implementation of the GST, its adoption is poised to help raise Indias medium-term GDP growth to above 8 per cent as it will create a single national market and enhance the efficiency of intra-Indian movement of goods and services,"" the IMF said in its annual country report on India. The IMF said larger than expected gains from the GST and further structural reforms could lead to significantly stronger growth, while a sustained period of continued low global energy prices would also be beneficial to India. Noting that Indias tax revenue-to-GDP ratio (at around 17 and a half per cent) remains considerably below than its emerging market peers, the IMF said the implementation of a robust GST should be a key priority given its growth-enhancing effects. ""The GST should have minimal exemptions, uniform cross-state rates, and as few tax rate tiers as possible,"" it said. Key production inputs, such as energy and real estate, should be kept within the tax base to enable greater output gains and reduce the tax burden across sectors, the IMF said. Rationalisation of the structure of direct taxes toward a lower corporate income tax rate with smaller and streamlined deductions and exemptions should continue, it said. Efforts to improve tax administration should be stepped up as the scope for revenue gains is large. According to the IMF report, Indian authorities were confident that the outstanding issues related to GST implementation could be settled promptly. ""The GST would provide for a significant improvement over the current indirect tax system. Tax reform priorities going forward include continuing the phased reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 30 to 25 per cent over four years, coupled with a simultaneous reduction in tax deductions,"" it said. The GST replaces a plethora of cascading center, state, interstate and local taxes with a single, nationwide, value-added tax on goods and services. "

"An inquiry by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau found that the Pawan Hans helicopter was flying at a critically low height, resulting in its crash near Bombay High in 2015. The report further mentioned that the instructor, despite being aware of the low height, didn't take control of the helicopter after the trainee pilot wasn?t able to manage the situation. ","Two years after a helicopter crash near the Bombay High offshore oil field killed two pilots, an inquiry by the Air Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) found that the chopper was flying at a critically low height, without the pilots realising it. The Pawan Hans helicopter was on a training sortie on the evening of November 4, 2015. Aviation regulator Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had asked AAIB?to conduct an inquiry. The inquiry report, which was made public on Wednesday, said that the main pilot was flying low and that the other did not realise it. After taking off, the Rontappmeyer (RYTYR) helicopter may have faced difficulties as the moon was waning, the report said. The report mentioned that the instructor, Captain E Samuel, wasn?t disoriented and was aware of the low height of the helicopter. He alerted Captain TK Guha a little late, but even after realising that Guha wasn?t able to manage the situation, Samuel did not take control of the helicopter.AAIB recommended that ONGC, which owns Bombay High along with the helicopter operators, identify helidecks from where night flying can take place. AAIB also said that Pawan Hans pilots need to rest sufficiently before flying. Guha was flying during the night after a gap of almost a year, read the report.

"The triple talaq case in the Supreme Court originated from the petition filed by Shayara Bano in 2016 in a case of divorce from her husband. Bano was given divorce through a 'talaqnama' sent to her while she was at her parents' place. A postgraduate in Sociology, Bano petitioned the court for a ban on triple talaq and polygamy.","When an under-confident, middle-class woman from a small town showed the courage to demand the scrapping of unilateral pronouncement of divorce in one sitting (triple talaq) people took note.Not only because she was an unlikely candidate to have challenged a religious practice but also because many were keen to know whether she can eventually force a change despite the opposition.THE STORY OF SHAIRA37- year-old Shaira Bano has taken her triple talaq case to the Supreme Court and citing it as an 'unfair practice' she has demanded it be abolished in India. She says she was duped into accepting a post that summarily broke her home. A marriage of 15 years was dissolved in minutes unilaterally with her husband dispatching a 'talaqnama' to her while she was at her parent's place in Kashipur, Uttarakhand recuperating from an illness. Shaira recounts, ""I spoke to him over the phone last year where he said he had left me. Then one day he said he was sending some property papers and that I must accept the post. I did. And when I opened it, there lay before me a divorce deed (talaqnama).""Shaira alleges she went through a harrowing time in the last 15 years of marriage. She was mentally tortured by demands of dowry initially. After she had two children, all subsequent pregnancies were forcefully aborted by her husband. Despite all this, she never protested, just so that she could save her home and not bring disrepute to her family.'KHULA' DIVORCEWhen I asked her mother about why she let her daughter suffer and not demand a 'khula', a divorce initiated by a woman, her mother claimed she were unaware of her daughter's plight. Shaira's mother, Firoza Bano, however later confessed that the family wanted to save the marriage from breaking somehow as they feared disrepute. She said, ""Since day one he (Shaira's husband) would say I will seek talaq but we are simple people and wanted our daughter to remain settled in the marriage.""Though Shaira has an MA in Sociology she has never worked. She was always financially dependent on her husband, who offered her a paltry 'meher' amount of about 16,000 rupees at the time of talaq. It is this 'unfairness' she says she has challenged but with this she has taken on those who refuse to entertain any thought of change to the Muslim personal laws. FIGHT AGAINST TRADITIONSHer brother Arshad told us ""The Muslim Personal Law Board has filed a petition against us saying we are going against the rules of Islam and they will not allow any change.""Member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, Kamal Farooqi told us that the Board has filed a rejoinder to Shaira's petition. According to him, ""Personal laws cannot be tampered with or changed for one case alone. Today they will want to change talaq laws, tomorrow they will intrude into other aspects like inheritance. This is unacceptable.""The AIMPLB is not alone in its opposition. No political party is willing to push for changes in personal laws. So much so that even the BJP that has been vocal on uniform civil code skirted the issue. Minority affairs minister Nejma Heptullah said that a ""demand for change should come from within the community."" The JD(U), Congress, Samajwadi party all voiced a similar opinion.However, Rajya Sabha MP and senior advocate KTS Tulsi took a different stand, ""Why can't the judiciary decide on something that is related to human right? Most Muslim countries have also done away with triple talaq, why can't we?"""

The PLA Daily?s report suggested the gear was moved after the face-off began.The reports did not say whether China moved the equipment to support military drills held in Tibet, including in the middle and lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo river, close to the border of India?s northeastern states, or for other reasons.Sources in the security establishment in New Delhi said there was ?no unusual military movement? in China during the past two months. The sources also said China had been conducting military exercises in the Tibet region since 2009. Ni Lexiong, a Shanghai-based military commentator, suggested to SCMP the movement of military equipment was most likely related to the standoff and could have been designed to bring India to the negotiating table.?Diplomatic talks must be backed by military preparation,? he said.Wang Dehua, from the South Asia Studies Centre at Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, said the scale of the troop and equipment movement showed how much easier it is for China to defend its western borders.?Military operations are all about logistics,? he told SCMP. ?Now there is much better logistics support to the Tibet region.?Beijing has accused New Delhi of ?illegal trespass? in Donglang sector and said the withdrawal of Indian troops is a must for resolving the face-off and opening talks.Donglang is under the control of Beijing but the area at the strategic tri-junction of India, Bhutan and China is claimed by Thimphu.India has said the road being built by the Chinese troops has serious security implications and will alter the status quo in the region.Earlier this week, state-run CCTV beamed footage of PLA troops from a mountain brigade engaged in a military exercise with live ammunition in the Tibet region. The location of the drill was not far from the Donglang and the state-run media reported that troops which were involved were ?responsible for frontline combat missions?.The live-fire drills included the ?quick delivery of troops and different military units working together on joint attacks?, the state media reported.

"China has deployed a Yuan class-conventional diesel-electric submarine in the Indian Ocean region, its seventh submarine to be deployed in the region. According to the Indian Navy, Chinese warships and submarines in the region appeared in 2013-14. Moreover, it also has its Haiwngxing spy ship deployed which picks up electronic signals that can be returned to Beijing for analysis.","In an aggressive move, China has deployed a submarine in the Indian Ocean Region, as the month long stand-off in the Doklam plateau between the Indian and Chinese People's Liberation Army continues.Wading through the Indian Ocean now is a Yuan class - conventional diesel electric - submarine which is better that aging Indian Sub. And this is not the first, but the seventh submarine to be deployed in the area.The submarine is being supported by Chinese Naval Ship (CNS) Chongmingdao - the Chinese Navy's submarine support vessel. Indian assets picked up the submarine entering the Indian Ocean Region recently.The Indian Navy has underlined the heightened Chinese People's Liberation Navy activity in the Indian Ocean Region to South Block. Chinese warships and submarines in Indian Ocean Region appeared three years ago 2013-14 - ostensible for anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden.But from a modest beginning of a flotilla of just three warships - two destroyers and a support ship - in 2013-14, more and more Chinese warships are prowling in the waters around India.WAR GAMESRecently, Indian satellites and naval assets have picked up at least 14 Chinese Navy warships in the Indian Ocean Region. These include the latest Luyang-III or the Kunming class stealth destroyers.Armed with surface-air and long range missiles the Chinese warships are projecting power far away from the Beijing's backyard but in India's immediate vicinity. The silver lining - India is constantly monitoring the movement of Chinese warships courtesy Indian satellites and long range maritime surveillance platforms.The Indian Navy's long range surveillance platforms like the US made P81 has been watching and recording movements of the Chinese Navy in the Indian Ocean. ""Over the years, we have augmented our capabilities manifold. More force multipliers are being added. We have the region covered as well,"" a senior officer told India Today.The first Chinese nuclear submarine was picked up in December 2013. The Shang Class- a nuclear propelled submarine-was deployed for almost three months in the waters around India till February 2014.It was followed by Song Class - diesel electric -submarine for another three months between August and December 2014. The Song Class followed by another nuclear vessel - a Han Class nuclear submarine. Last year China deployed a nuclear submarine - a Han Class Nuclear submarine - and a conventional submarine respectively.WORRYING SIGN?These boats were snooped around the Indian Ocean for over six months. The Yuan class submarine detected by the Indian Navy this year is first the submarine to be sent to the Indian Ocean Region in 2017. Worryingly for India, the increased warship deployment goes hand in hand with the deployment of Hydrographic, Oceanographic vessels and spy-ships in the Indian Ocean to map the sea bed.Bathymetric data among other things detail how currents and noise behave at particular depth, the lay of the ocean floor are critical for submarine deployments.Top sources told India Today that Chinese Naval Ship Haiwngxing -spy ship -entered the Indian Ocean this month. The spy ship equipped with sophisticated equipment is deployed to collect electronic intelligence among other things. It is capable of honing on electronic signals which can be returned to China for analysis.

"US President Donald Trump's son Donald Trump Jr on Tuesday released emails showing he was offered ""sensitive"" information on Hillary Clinton by a Russian lawyer before the US presidential elections. Trump Jr was reportedly informed ahead of a meeting with the lawyer that the information was part of an effort by the Russian government to help the Trump campaign.","Donald Trump Jr has been forced to release damning emails that reveal he eagerly embraced what he was told was a Russian government attempt to damage Hillary Clinton?s election campaign.The stunning disclosure raised questions over whether campaign laws were broken and why senior Trump associates failed to report a hostile act by a foreign power.Trump Jr also admitted on Tuesday night that he could have handled the situation better but he had not told his father about meeting a Russian lawyer because ?it was a nothing?.The emails show music promoter Rob Goldstone telling the future US president?s son that ?the crown prosecutor of Russia? had offered ?to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father?.British-born Goldstone adds in the exchange of 3 June 2016: ?This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government?s support for Mr Trump.?Seventeen minutes later, Trump Jr welcomes this with the reply: ?If it?s what you say, I love it, especially later in the summer.?In a later email, Goldstone describes the Russian lawyer they are due to meet, Natalia Veselnitskaya, as a ?Russian government attorney?.Natalia Veselnitskaya is the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort at Trump Tower on 9 June 2016. Trump Jr has published emails showing Veselnitskaya was introduced to him as a ?Russian government attorney? who had damaging information about Hillary Clinton.Veselnitskaya is a defence lawyer based just outside Moscow, whose main client in recent years has been Denis Katsyv, a businessman accused of profiting from a major tax fraud uncovered by lawyer Sergei Magnitsky. She fought his case in US courts and mounted a PR campaign to try to clear Katsyv?s name and overturn the ?Magnitsky Act? sanctions against Russian officials that followed.Veselnitskaya is not a government official and portrays herself as a lawyer with a private client. The question, then, is how she was able to secure the meeting at Trump Tower during a presidential campaign and why she was introduced to Trump Jr as representing the Russian government.Trump Jr agrees, adding that he would probably be accompanied by ?Paul Manafort (campaign boss)? and ?my brother-in-law,? Jared Kushner, husband of Trump?s daughter Ivanka and now a senior White House adviser.The formatting of the emails suggests that Trump Jr forwarded the whole chain to Manafort and Kushner before the meeting the three attended with Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in New York on 9 June.On Sunday, Trump Jr had said he had asked Manafort and Kushner to attend but not told them what the meeting was about. An associate of Manafort said on Tuesday that the former campaign chairman claims not to have read to the bottom of the chain of emails forwarded to him and Kushner by Trump Jr about the meeting. Jamie Gorelick, an attorney for Jared Kushner, did not respond to questions about whether Kushner read the emails and why he attended the meeting.Critics seized on the new disclosures to question why three of Trump?s closest advisers were willing to accept such a meeting instead of alerting authorities to interference by a foreign adversary. Special counsel Robert Mueller and the House and Senate intelligence committees are investigating Russian meddling in the election, thought to include stealing Democratic National Committee emails and the use of social-media bots to spread fake news about Clinton.My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency.Trump Jr has offered shifting explanations for the meeting in recent days. In an interview broadcast on conservative Fox News on Tuesday night, he again sought to justify his motives but conceded that he could have handled the situation better.?In retrospect I probably would have done things a little differently,? he told interviewer Sean Hannity. ?Again this is before the Russia mania, this is before they were building this up in the press.Trump Jr denied that he told his father about the meeting. ?It was just a nothing,? he added. ?There was nothing to tell. I mean, I wouldn?t have even remembered it until you started scouring through this stuff. It was literally just a wasted 20 minutes, which was a shame.?Trump spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders read a short statement from the president at the regular White House press briefing. ?My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency.?She then refused to answer several questions on the matter, saying they must be directed to Trump Jr?s legal counsel and outside counsel.Asked about the president?s reaction to the unfolding drama, Huckabee Sanders replied: ?I think the president is, I would say, frustrated with the process, the fact this continues to be an issue and he would love for us to be focused on issues like the economy, healthcare, tax reform, infrastructure.?Clinton?s running mate Tim Kaine, a senator from Virginia and member of the foreign relations committee, told MSNBC: ?These emails are explosive. This should have set off alarm bells and red lights, and yet what it seemed to do is activate their salivatory glands. This is just wheelbarrows of new evidence for the special counsel and the Senate intelligence committee.?Trump Jr released the email chain on Tuesday apparently to pre-empt its publication by the New York Times, which, this weekend, first broke the news of his meeting with Veselnitskaya in June last year. Veselnitskaya had promised compromising information about Clinton but apparently failed to deliver.In a statement posted to Twitter, Trump Jr explained: ?To everyone, in order to be totally transparent, I am releasing the entire email chain of my emails with Rob Goldstone about the meeting on June 9, 2016. To put this in context, this occurred before the current Russian fever was in vogue.?There is no such position as crown prosecutor of Russia, but the most likely candidate would be the long-serving prosecutor general, and a long-standing member of Vladimir Putin?s elite, Yuri Chaika.Goldstone told the Wall Street Journal his reference to the ?crown prosecutor? was meant to mean Veselnitskaya. ?It?s a language thing,? he said. He referred questions from the Guardian to his lawyer.Trump Jr has given varying reasons for why he accepted the meeting, first claiming it was to discuss American adoptions of Russian children, then acknowledging that he was interested in information about Clinton.The president?s eldest son denies any wrongdoing and tweeted on Tuesday: ?Media and Dems are extremely invested in the Russia story. If this nonsense meeting is all they have after a year, I understand the desperation!?Goldstone told the Associated Press on Monday he set up the meeting on behalf of a client, pop star Emin Agalarov, the son of a Moscow-based developer, Aras Agalarov, who has close ties to Putin and tried to partner with Trump in a hotel project.Aras Agalarov worked with Donald Trump to bring the Miss Universe contest to Moscow in 2013. Trump appeared in a music video with Emin Agalarov that featured several Miss Universe contestants.Goldstone?s 3 June email says the Russian government?s support for Trump is ?helped along by Aras and Emin?. He asks if Trump Jr wants to speak to Emin about it directly and proposes: ?I can also send this info to your father via Rhona? ? presumably Rhona Graff, Donald Trump?s longtime executive assistant ? ?but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first.? It is not clear from the emails whether Goldstone did send any of the information to Trump Sr, who has denied all knowledge of the meeting through his lawyer. Before the publication of Trump Jr?s emails, Veselnitskaya had denied she had gone to the meeting with information about the Clinton campaign. ?It?s quite possible that maybe they were looking for such information, they wanted it so badly,? she told NBC, denying that she had any to offer. She also answered ?no? when asked if she had ever worked for the Russian government.Later, Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the US, dismissed the significance of the Trump Jr meeting. ?I don?t think anything about it and to be honest there are more serious things to be think about in relation to Russia,? he told the Guardian at a US-Russia Business Council farewell reception in Washington.Trump Jr was at Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday, according to a police officer at the building.Eric Trump, Donald Jr?s brother, was spotted in the lobby at around 1.30pm with his wife Lara. Asked by the Guardian if he had any comment on his brother?s emails or knew Goldstone himself, Eric Trump did not respond. He then headed quickly to a gold elevator and headed upwards, staring silently ahead.The revelations around 39-year-old Trump Jr?s involvement is one of the biggest blows yet in the saga of the Trump campaign?s alleged ties to Russia, which the president has dismissed as a ?hoax?.Republicans on Capitol Hill were taken aback but reluctant to weigh in just yet. At least two Republicans on the Senate intelligence committee, Senators John Cornyn and James Lankford, said Trump Jr should testify before the panel, which is overseeing one of three parallel investigations into Russian interference in the US election.John McCain, a frequent critic of the Trump administration, said there were ?many allusions and many stories of meetings and communications?, while noting he expected there was more yet to come.Richard Burr, the Republican chief of the Senate intelligence committee, said it was ?too early to draw any conclusions?.Burr?s Democratic counterpart, Mark Warner, said it was significant that the emails had been forwarded to Kushner and Manafort.?They?ve got a lot of explaining to do, because all these denials of any knowledge of Russian government involvement seems to be a gross contradiction here,? Warner told Roll Call.Some of Trump?s most ardent defenders nonetheless stood by the president. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who competed bitterly against Trump for the Republican nomination, blamed the media for fixating on Russia.?Russia is a significant adversary,? he told reporters. ?Part of the irony of this media obsession with Russia is that the Obama administration began with Hillary Clinton bringing the big reset button with Russia.Norm Eisen, former ethics czar under President Barack Obama, said: ?It?s another significant step forward in the investigation of Trump collusion with Russia because it represents an offer to collude and an acceptance of collusion to harm the campaign of Hillary Clinton and intrude upon our democracy.?He added: ?I believe it?s potentially legally actionable but we need to let the investigation play out. I predict it will not be the last bombshell.?Additional reporting by Shaun Walker in Moscow and Oliver Laughland and Jon Swaine in New YorkHere's my statement and the full email chain pic.twitter.com/x050r5n5LQHere is page 4 (which did not post due to space constraints). pic.twitter.com/z1Xi4nr2gq"

"The International Tiger Day, an annual celebration to promote a system for protecting natural habitats of tigers and to raise public awareness for tiger conservation, is celebrated worldwide on July 29. It was first observed in 2010 at the Saint Petersburg Tiger Summit. Reportedly, the world has lost 97% of all wild tigers in a bit over 100 years.","The global tiger day was created to think of the needs of a wild tiger. Sadly we have forgotten this primary objective. What I am going to do is to spell out the Indian tiger?s wishlist in the hope that those that engage with tigers will rethink and review their strategies.The most important item on the wishlist is to see a mindset change in the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) where this specially created institution starts to imbibe field wisdom about wild tigers through innovative strategies on both protection and tourism. Tigers love well-managed visitors. They keep the forest staff on alert and can provide vital information on illegal grazing, wood felling and poaching. After all, there are hundreds of more eyes and ears looking and hearing. In places where tourism is low, tigers have suffered hugely. The NTCA must learn to respect site-specific initiatives of state governments that can through tourism revenue make our tiger reserves self sufficient. This in turn provides field directors to undertake vital protection work without bureaucratic delays. The NTCA in the last decade has discouraged tourism and endlessly interfered with state government policy seriously impacting the health of tigers. Managing tigers is a state subject and the NTCA must be in the role of facilitator and not policeman.The chief wildlife wardens of the states are vital to the tigers? wishlist. They need to take bold and innovative decisions that inspire the field staff. They need to engage with local communities in the effort to protect tigers. They need to ensure that all vacant positions are filled and chief ministers engaged with all the issues that confront wild tigers. State-of-the-art training is an essential element in the quality of governance that is needed to protect tigers. Retired army officers can instruct on field craft, retired intelligence officials on gathering intelligence on poachers and their syndicates. Our country can offer the best talent to secure the future of wild tigers. Inter-state cooperation is vital to good governance and even more important than linking up with the central government. Rajasthan has held such a meeting with Maharashtra so that both can imbibe best practices from each other. Choose forest staff with care. Good decisions are made by those who spend time understanding tigers. Ignorant decisions damage the future of tigers. The four or five big NGOs must revitalise their thinking and prevent duplication. Focus on specific trouble spots and solve problems with tactical help to the forest staff. Do not beat your own drum. Partner with local communities. The future of tigers will lie in how communities engage in protection. The time for sweet talking them is over. Gather the young and train them into tiger protectors.All this requires strong political will. Tigers need chief ministers at their side. Their instructions are vital to innovative initiatives and this is where strong partnerships between the government and non-governmental sector can trigger the necessary political will. Frequent meetings of the state board of wildlife that chief ministers chair are vital to resolving the tigers? problems.The Prime Minister of the country must play his role for the sake of our national animal. The Prime Minister chairs the national board for wildlife and frequent meetings are a must. The full board has not met for four years. This is the moment to meet and the best experts must apprise the Prime Minister of the tigers? needs.These are the five points on the wish list of India?s wild tigers. And who says it is not possible? Rajasthan has shown the way. Under the supervision of the chief minister, the Ranthambhore tiger reserve has shown the highest amount of tigers ever now touching 65 with the highest tourist revenue now touching 4 million dollars just on entry ticket revenue. It has some of the best local community monitoring and protection and a genuine partnership with field forest staff. It has the best tourism practices and regular monthly meetings of an empowered committee that reports back to the chief minister. For the first time ever, extra tourism revenue is going to new tiger habitats that suffered tremendously due to limited funds.Where there is a will there is a way. It is up to all of us to make it the day of the tiger.Valmik Thapar has worked for 42 years with wild tigers. He has also written 30 books on India?s tigers and wildlife"
"More than 28,000 children aged less than six years have died in Madhya Pradesh in 2016, state's Women and Child Welfare Department Minister Archana Chitnis apprised the Assembly. ""Technically, It is impossible to answer how many children died because of malnourishment because children died because of various diseases, which could have resulted from malnourishment,"" she stated.","More than 28,000 children aged less than six years have died in Madhya Pradesh in the past one year due to malnourishment and diseases resulting from it.The state women and child welfare department while accepting that children died because of disease resulting from malnourishment refuses to attribute even a single death to malnourishment.Women and child welfare department minister Archana Chitnis read out an answer to a question raised by Ram Niwas Rawat of the Congress in the ongoing budget session of the Assembly in which she accepted that 28948 children had died in the state in the past one year. And though malnourishment related deaths have been reported from across the state she refused to attribute even a single death to malnourishment.""Technically It is impossible to answer how many children died because of malnourishment because children died because of various disease which could have resulted from malnourishment. But I can tell you as far as malnourishment figures are concerned we have improved on all parameters,"" Archana Chitnis said while talking to India Today.Children have died across the state but we chose to do a reality check in Satna where according to the minister's reply 2167 children below the age of 6 have died due to various reasons. Majhagava block is the worst affected where around 1000 malnourished kids who have been admitted to the rehabilitation centres set up by the government. Many deaths have been reported from the 19 odd tribal dominated villages that fall in this block but the government is not willing to accept malnourishment and severe malnourishment as the cause.Leader of opposition Ajay Singh however attributes corruption as the cause behind the rising deaths of infants in Madhya Pradesh. ""Satna is there, also Chitrakoot is there and in Majhgava block there is severe malnourishment. The reason behind this is corruption. Those who are supposed to supply nutritional food are associated with the BJP and till the time this cartel is broken malnourishment cannot be tackled in Madhya Pradesh,"" he told India Today.If we break down the annual death figure of 28948 into days a shocking statistic stares at your face. 79 children aged below six years die every day in Madhya Pradesh and this shows that the infant mortality rate in Madhya Pradesh is worse than even many African nations. Whatever may be the cause the government has some serious thinking to do."
"The Gujarat government has decided to celebrate the 'World Heritage City' status granted to Ahmedabad by UNESCO for a fortnight. The programme, starting on August 1, will include heritage walks, cultural events, lectures and seminars about the 600-year-old city. Further, all flights to Gujarat will serve Gujarati cuisine to passengers during the 2-week-long celebration.","The BJP-led Gujarat government is going all out to celebrate the world heritage city status accorded to Ahmedabad by UNESCO earlier this month with an eye on assembly elections later this year. The fortnight-long celebrations will start from August 1, aiming to give a boost to the city?s image through people?s participation. As part of the gala event, the state government in association with central ministries has chalked out elaborate programmes for a two-week-long festival, which includes heritage walk, cultural events, lectures and seminars to showcase the over 600-year-old city founded by emperor Ahmed Shah.

It is a big boost for the city to be given the world heritage status,? said a state government official. The elaborate programmes also aimed at highlighting the heritage-tag for the Ahmedabad as a major success story of the BJP government in the state. The celebrations will coincide with Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s visit to his home  state on August 12 to inaugurate the Sardar Sarovar dam on the Narmada. Chief ministers of 12 states ruled by BJP and its allies are expected to attend the event.Ahmedabad is the first Indian city to get the coveted heritage status. Earlier Delhi and Mumbai had also tried to get the tag but failed to make the cut. Gujarat had sent its proposal to UNESCO way back in 2010 when Modi was the CM of the state.A detailed presentation on how the city plans to celebrate the ?world heritage city? status was made by Ahmedabad municipal commissioner at then housing and urban affairs minister M Venkaiah Naidu?s residence on Monday. This was the last assignment of Naidu before he demitted office after being named the NDA?s vice president candidate.Also present in the meeting were Union textiles minister Smriti Irani and civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapati Raju.

The fortnight-long event will also see the launch of a hop-on-hop-off heritage bus tour and special merchandize and souvenirs, depicting various facets of the heritage city."
"Too many shops and restaurants at Delhi Airport could hinder evacuations and jeopardise the lives of passengers during an emergency, a parliamentary panel has concluded in a draft report. It said, ""The advice of security agencies is being overlooked for commercial interests."" Delhi International Airport Limited and the Civil Aviation Ministry have ignored the safety concerns, the report claimed.","Too many shops and restaurants at New Delhi?s Indira Gandhi international airport could jeopardise lives of passengers during an emergency but the airport operator and the government have ignored these safety concerns, a parliamentary panel has concluded.In a draft report, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) saw the commercial establishments as a ?big hindrance? to evacuation plans. CISF handles airport security across the country.HT accessed the draft report that was taken up for adoption at the PAC meeting last week.The committee indicted the operators, Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) and the ministry of civil aviation for what it says was the ?unscientific commercial usage? of the space available for passengers, especially restaurants, retail outlets, duty-free complexes and executive lounges. ?The advice of security agencies is being overlooked for commercial interests,? the report said, while also deprecating ?the complicity? of the civil aviation ministry. ?Members of the committee felt that mishap or disaster could be foreseen given the present state of narrow lanes for movement of passengers?. According to the report, CISF director-general OP Singh raised the issues in letters to the civil aviation ministry but got no response. A delegation of 14 PAC members met Singh during a visit to the airport?s two passenger terminals on March 7.The CISF DG did not give a comment for this story. A ministry spokesperson too did not offer any comment on the PAC?s observations.The PAC also noted that it received feedback from air passengers association of India (APAI) that the experience of flyers is ?nightmarish?: services are expensive, lounges and restrooms are dirty, quality of food sub-par, food courts ill-managed, seating facility at lounges not adequate, and baggage handling counters are inconvenient.?The committee was told that though feedback forms are available, no action is taken on these suggestions/complaints. The committee deplores the laxity of MoCA (ministry of civil aviation) for not taking strict action against the operators in this regard.? The Delhi International Airport Private Ltd (DIAL) is a joint venture consortium led by the GMR Group.A DIAL spokesperson said the airport?s terminals were well within global aviation standards in terms of the proportion of area given out to commercial setups with respect to the overall size of the terminal. ?In the last six years, IGI airport has retained a stellar ranking in Airport Service Quality (ASQ). The airport serves as a model to most other airports in India and worldwide on parameters such as passenger amenities, user friendliness, accessibility, cleanliness, security, entertainment, retail offerings and various other aspects,? the spokesperson said. The two terminals, T1 and T3, serve more than 150,000 passengers every day with nearly 1,200 flights arriving or departing.HT has reported that the domestic terminal, T1, currently handles more passengers than it was designed for. The adoption of the report was deferred, according to sources, due to differences of opinion over the demand by a BJP MP that the panel should recommend a CBI inquiry into the alleged violations of the agreement between DIAL and the airport authority of India. The panel also criticised the airport operators for licensing out land around the terminals without making any study about the passenger movement, their accommodation needs and accessibility to the airport ?which is evident from a large number of hotels cropping up in the area and consequent illegal use of the licensed land for other purposes.? The delegation that visited the airport comprised chairman KV Thomas, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey, BJD MP Bhartruhari Mahtab and Congress MP Shantaram Naik, and 10 other parliamentariansThe panel also expressed reservation against the ?unethical? development fee on passengers, saying that they should not be made to pay for airport infrastructure that is the ?sole responsibility? of DIAL and its shareholders."
"The British-era Bawana Jail is one of the 19 monuments being renovated by the Delhi Archeology Department. The abandoned 19th-century structure, which has also served as an orphanage and school, was once used to imprison revenue defaulters and villagers who failed to pay the Zaildari tax. It resembles a fortress and features an arched gateway.","After a game of cards under the warm sun in front of the tehsil in Bawana village, Baljeeet Singh (76) a retired municipal school inspector prepares to leave. As he limps back to his house in a nearby lane, he stops at the arched entrance of the tehsil, a British-era structure that is being restored by the State Archeology Department in collaboration with the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage.?Ye theek kar rahe hain, pichhli baar cement bhar diya tha (They are renovating it using the technology. Earlier, they just filled cement),? he says.?This used to be my school. I have studied here up to Class 6. Like several others in the village, my life has revolved around this place. I spent most of my childhood here studying under the tree or playing in the dry well,? he adds.RestorationThe single-storey structure, made of lakhori bricks, is being renovated under the state archaeology department?s plan to conserve 19 monuments in Delhi, including Talkatora Garden embankment, tombs in Mehrauli Archeological Park, gateways of Chirag Dilli, and structures in Mehram Nagar.The area covers on 200 square yard complex.?We are using materials which were used in that era for restoration. The mixture is a preparation of lime, surkhi (trass), jaggery, and bael fruit (wood apple) pulp. In that period, around 23 ingredients were used in construction including urad ki daal (pulse),? said a conservator. The doorway opens into a courtyard surrounded by corridors and has two rooms in the extreme corner on the left. Villagers were confined in these two rooms if they were not able to pay up zaildari tax.

						Bawana JailThe structure looks like a fortress from outside, and has one arched gateway. The doorway opens into a courtyard surrounded by corridors and has two rooms in the extreme corner on the left. Villagers were confined in these two rooms if they were not able to pay up zaildari tax. The compound, flanked by modern-day houses still has old peepal, banyan, and neem trees.The complex housed one of the four zails (administrative units tasked with revenue collection) in Delhi. Revenue defaulters were also imprisoned here and so it came to be known as Bawana Jail.It was constructed in the 1860s when the zaildari system (revenue collection plan) was introduced. The in-charge of the jail was called zaildar or numberdar. Three villages ? Bawana, Alipur, and Kanjhawala were under its jurisdiction. Bawana tehsil was among the four administrative divisions with Mehrauli, Dilli, and Najafgarh.Next to the rooms is a small staircase, which leads to the terrace. There are bastions on all four corners on the terrace, which were used as guard posts too.?There used to be a small well inside the complex but it was filled long back. Later on, the water turned salty hence was not being used for drinking. I remember, children stumbled upon old coins when they would play on the premises,? says Master Dhani Ram (85), a retired headmaster, who studied at the school from 1942 to 1947.Over the yearsAround the 1930-40s, the building was converted into a school, which continued after the Partition. For a brief period, it served as a veterinary hospital. Later, it was converted into an orphanage, which was closed in 1981. When Sahib Singh Verma became the chief minister of Delhi, it served as patwari office (official who maintains land records) for some time.Since then the structure was abandoned and dilapidating. A major portion of walls was missing from the outer and inner face. The parapet also collapsed.In 2004, the Delhi government?s archaeology department carried out restoration of the historical site along with two dozen other monument across the city. The government also planned to convert it into a freedom fighter?s museum then. The proposal never materialised. Another failed attempt to conserve it was made in 2010 as it was to be showcased during the Commonwealth Games.?After its renovation, the government should maintain it. This will help glorify the contribution of Bawana in the making of Delhi,? Ram says.A senior official of the archaeology department, however, said the priority is to preserve the heritage.A glimpse into the history Bawana was established in 1168. It is believed that Jats came to settle here from Taoru, now in Haryana. Before making Bawana their final abode, they spent considerable time at Mehrauli too.Bawana was a cluster of 52 villages (Narela-17, Karala -17, Palam-6, and Bawana-12) with vast agricultural lands sprawled in about 52,000 acres. The village derived its name from the word ?Bawan?, which means 52 in Hindi. A plaque installed above the entrance of the tehsil reads: ?From the zails of Bawana, Kanjhaola, and Alipur, 1,231 men went to the great war (first World War, 1914-1919). Of these, 81 gave up their lives.? "

Speaking on the trend of recreating old songs, he said, ""It's a great way for our youth of today to connect with these songs."" Mika is known for songs like 'Sawan Mein Lag Gayi Aag', 'Mauja Hi Mauja', 'Gandi Baat', among others.","Mumbai, Jun 17 (PTI) Mika Singh says singers should be given priority over film stars when it comes to doing playback in films. Of late a lot of female and male actors have done playback for songs in their films and also managed to strike a chord with the audiences.

"A 190-year-old temple in Mumbai's Byculla has installed a 37.5-kilowatt rooftop solar system with 115 panels which will enable it to cut down its annual electricity bill by ?8 lakh. The temple management will reportedly install more panels by the end of this year. Notably, about 20 religious institutions in Mumbai have switched to solar power.","A 190-year-old Jain temple at Byculla is the latest addition to the growing list of religious and educational institutions and housing societies, who are harnessing solar energy for an eco-friendly future. Sheth Motisha Jain Temple, spread across two acres, installed a 37.5 kilo-watt (KW) power rooftop solar system with 115 panels earlier this month, which will help the management save Rs8 lakh on electricity bills annually. The system will power lights and fans along the pathways, bhojanalaya (mess), storerooms and guest accommodations for devotees. The trustees who  took up the initiative claimed theirs was first temple in Byculla to which harnessed solar energy. ?With soaring temperatures, electricity consumption has increased. This electricity is generated at plants that use coal, gas or oil to generate electricity. The process releases harmful chemicals into the air and adds to the pollution,? said Kiranrajji Mangalilalji Shah, chairperson, Sheth Motisha Jain Religious and Charitable Trust. He added,?Each system has advantages and disadvantages, but renewable resources do not exploit any exhaustible resources. So we decided to rely on solar energy to produce electricity.? So far, about 20 religious institutions in the city have switched to solar power.Other trust members added that more panels will be installed by the year-end. ?The present installation is the first phase of the project. Our aim is to convert the entire campus into solar power zone. We are happy to give something back to the society and achieve our goal of maintaining an environmental balance,? said Jagdishchandra Chandulalji Mehta, managing trustee. The setup installed atop the building, which provides lodging facilities to devotees, on the temple premises on average generates 160 kilowatt hour (kWh) electricity per day. A Mumbai house with two bedrooms, on an average, uses 8 to 10 kWh electricity daily. ?We first want to test the system for three months before installing more panels in the phase II. During summers, the power generated is expected to be much more. We are using two German inverters to produce electricity in the first phase,? said Partth Kothari, company partner, Appsolar LLP, a private company that installed the project. The trust has also installed a net-metering system, which allows surplus power generated by solar to be exported back to the grid and any deficiency is imported from the grid. ?The benefits will be reflected every month in the temple?s electricity bills,? said Ghaverchandji Jivrajji Sanghvi, trustee, adding that the trust spent Rs 26 lakh to install the system with the help of donations from devotees. ?We expect to recover this in the next three years.?In the phase II of the project, the trust wants to convert the entire temple area into a green zone by planting fruiting trees along the periphery and within the temple complex.Satish Gavai, additional chief secretary, state environment department, said, ?We congratulate the different religious groups that have come forward and adopted renewable energy means to produce electricity. Religion can be one of the strongest sources of motivation for people to adopt green practices. These initiatives will encourage devotees to adopt such practices and contribute towards protecting the environment.? "

						Two months short of 95, she had been keeping unwell for some time. She breathed her last at 7.24 pm, as a result of multiple system failure triggered by a natural weakening due to old age, according to an official spokesperson. Former Union minister and Amarinder?s wife Preneet Kaur was with her.

","On July 5th, India Today had reported that a painting, 'Flying Apsara', made by eminent painter Jatin Das for Air India in 1991 had gone missing from the airline's archives. Das had stumbled upon information that the painting made exclusively for the national carrier, had reached the open market.The ""missing"" painting now has miraculously resurfaced.A mysterious package arrived at Air India's head office, Airlines House, in New Delhi a week after Das raised a stink about the missing painting.This unnamed package contained the same said painting that Das had made for Air India. It was rolled up and delivered in a damaged condition.Air India immediately tried to trace back the sender. The courier, unfortunately, had been sent from an address in Gurugram that turned out to be fictitious.After India Today had highlighted the art loot, that appeared to be a larger malaise than the case of one missing painting, Air India had set up an internal enquiry committee to look into the matter.The committee has learnt that the painting was last seen in the office of a former executive director who worked out of the Delhi office of the airline a decade ago.

The minister initially stood by his actions and said, ""Islam teaches respect for all religions."" He later apologised for his actions after a meeting with Nitish Kumar.","A Muslim cleric on Sunday issued a ?fatwa? against newly appointed Bihar minister and Janata Dal (United) leader Khurshid alias Firoz Ahmad for chanting Jai Shri Ram, saying his marriage would be terminated for his ?mistake?.An MLA from Sikta in West Champaran, Ahmad shouted the slogan, normally associated with BJP supporters, outside the Bihar assembly on Friday after chief minister Nitish Kumar won the trust vote he faced after breaking ties with the RJD-Congress alliance and joining hands with the BJP.The fatwa, or a decree, against the only Muslim minister in Kumar?s new cabinet was issued by Mufti Sohail Quasmi of Imarat Shariah, which describes itself as a socio-religious organisation active in Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha.?Islam teaches respect for all religions. If by saying Jai Shri Ram I can do some good for the Muslims, why is there such a hue and cry,? Ahmad, who has been given charge of minority welfare and sugarcane industries, told mediapersons.He would not be cowed down by such threats, he said.The minister later apologised for his statement, while talking to a TV channel.?The CM told me if anybody felt hurt by my statement, I should apologise.

Bihar BJP spokesman Azfar Shamshi said.Ahmad had taken forward the Indian tradition while the fatwa was against it. ?The days are gone when Muslims were waylaid on sentimental issues. Now, they want solutions to their core issues,? he said.Maryada Purushottam Ram was known as Imam-e-Hind (an ideal person), he said, adding Indonesia, which has the world?s highest number of Muslims, had named its national carrier named Garuda while several building were named Ramayan.In Hindu mythology, Garuda is the mount of Lord Vishnu. Ram is an incarnation of Vishnu.?It is the spirit of Ram that is important and there is no need to fan sentiments,? Shamshi said.India has always been as a country of Ram and Raheem and there should not be any effort to create a divide, JD-U spokesman Neeraj Kumar said.?Gandhi ji talked of Ram and Raheem in the same breath. Former president APJ Abdul Kalam observed both Ramazan and Navratra. Ahmad has just reflected the ?Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb of the country,? he said.As part of the so-called grand alliance, Nitish Kumar had worked hard to woo the Muslim community and his decision to join hands with the BJP is unlikely to go down well it.His decision to go with the RJD and the Congress to oppose the ?communal agenda? of the BJP saw the minority community support him in 2015 state election.

The figure is expected to rise to three times during the next phase of the study to be conducted on inferior road stretches.The study, commissioned in May, released its preliminary findings last week involving a Sports Utility Vehicle with a mileage of 10 -12 km/litre. Subsequent tests will be conducted with small cars and loaded and empty trucks. The findings use a three-tier grading system to assess road conditions. Traffic congestion is also a parameter.The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Central Road Research Institute (CSIR-CRRI) conducted the study. It was found that an SUV consumed about 40.25 millilitres of fuel per kilometre when it travelled on the Noida Expressway, considered a good, fuel-efficient road. The same vehicle consumed about 95.5 millilitres of fuel for every kilometre when travelling from Noida Expressway to Kalindi Kunj and onto Jasola.The consumption was even higher at 137.2 millilitres per km when the vehicle travelled from Botanical Garden to Kailash Hospital in Noida. ?The initial findings of the study conducted on two road stretches in Delhi have revealed that Delhiites could be consuming at least two-to-three times more fuel because of bad quality roads and traffic conditions,? said Ravindra Kumar, principal scientist of CRRI?s transport and planning division.?The result is they end up paying more.?A preliminary estimate puts the wastage across India at Rs 960 crore a day.

The call was made from the mobile phone of Gaurav Gupta, an animal activist and office bearer an office bearer of People for Animals (PFA).

According to financial experts, the increase in thedefence budget comes in the light of cross border tensions with India, Afghanistan and Iran.Experts also say that though Pakistan Army has been rooting out terrorism from its own soil, through military operations Zarb-e-Azb, Khyber-I, Khyber-II and now Rad-ul-Fasad, tensions between India and Pakistan have only increased. India has accused Pakistan of supporting militants, who infiltrate from the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir into the Valley and target Indian security forces. One such attack in September last year killed 18 Indian soldiers and India retaliated with ""surgical strikes"" on terrorist launchpads in PoK. Most recently, the Pakistan Army sentenced Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav on charges of espionage after a secret trial. India had demanded consular access to Jadhav, which Pakistan repeatedly denied, claiming the man was an Indian spy. India and Pakistan are also at loggerheads over a China- backed economic corridor that runs through PoK. China says it is a developmental project and will aid Pakistan's economy.

"Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav on Saturday campaigned for his brother Shivpal Singh Yadav in Etawah and also sought votes for a Lok Dal candidate. He, however, didn't mention UP CM Akhilesh Yadav's name. This came amid reports that some Mulayam's loyalists, who were denied tickets by the SP, are now contesting on the Lok Dal ticket.","The spring may have gone out of Mulayam Singh Yadav's step after he was unseated from the leadership of the Samajwadi Party by his son Akhilesh Yadav, but he still retains his ability to sting. Evidence of that came at the rally that he addressed this afternoon at Jaswantnagar in his home district of Etwah. He  came here asking for votes for his brother Shivpal Yadav but what was more interesting was his open support for a Lok Dal candidate from the Etwah seat.Mulayam rooting for the Lok Dal candidate is significant. The party exists mainly on paper and is distinct from the Rashtriya Lok Dal, which is headed by Ajit Singh. After Mulayam Singh Yadav was tossed out as the president of his party, he, along with Shivpal, toyed with the idea of taking over the Lok Dal, but ultimately decided against it.Speculation abounds in political circles that close to 40 of the duo's loyalists who were denied tickets by the SP are now contesting on the Lok Dal ticket. If a handful of them manage to win, they could strengthen Mulayam's hand in the event of a hung Assembly.Also read: Samajwadi feud: Mulayam-Akhilesh fight leaves Shivpal supporters in limboYADAV CLAN ABSENT AT SHIVPAL RALLYAlthough Etwah happens to be the family bastion of the Yadav family, not one member of the larger Yadav clan has been out seeking votes for Shivpal. Conspicuous by their absence from today's rally were the chief minister and MPs Ram Gopal Yadav, Dimple Yadav, Dharmendar Yyadav, Tej Pratap Yadav and Akshay Yadav.A significant feature of Shivpal's campaign and today's rally was that votes were sought in the name of Mulayam Singh Yadav and the development work that has taken place in the district during his time as chief minister and by Shivpal as the state irrigation and PWD minister. No mention was made of Akhilesh Yadav or any of that development work done by his government."

AAP has often accused the Delhi Police, which reports to the union home ministry, of harassment and acting at the behest of the Modi government, a charge denied by the force.It described the arrests as ?political conspiracy? to destabilise the Kejriwal government.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal repeated the accusations last week after the CBI opened a probe against deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and health minister Satyendar Jain?s daughter on corruption charges.Granting bail to Akhilesh Tripathi in a case if sexual harassment and molestation, the court said the complainant?s statement was self-contradictory and cross-examination had discredited her testimony.Senior AAP leader Dilip Pandey said instead of focusing on the law and order, the Delhi Police were busy targeting AAP MLAs.?The NDA government has not been able to accept the defeat in Delhi elections. Because of its ego and political frustration, it is not letting the Delhi government work,? Pandey said.Delhi Police officers were not willing to come on record. ?There should not be an iota of doubt against the police. The complainants in the case are not police.

Malana is an isolated village in the Parvati Valley and its reclusive inhabitants are said to be descendants of soldiers of Alexander?s army.A few months back, the village had banned photography because villagers felt that visitors clicking pictures were portraying Malana as a hub of narco-tourism. ?It?s unfortunate that cannabis trade has defamed our village. People of this village have their own culture and beliefs,? said Mahila Mandal pradhan Ram Kali, adding that they have been struggling to shed this cannabis tag.Vivek Mohan, winner of a national award for his critically acclaimed documentary on Malana, said, ?Malana managed to preserve its culture due to two factors: devotion to Devta Jamlu and its geographical isolation. Now both are getting diluted due to the Malana hydro project and mobile telephony. Their devotion to the devta is keeping them together, but how long will it be before it becomes a cosmetic ritual.?Traditionally, inhabitants of this land-locked village used to make baskets, ropes and slippers from hemp. But in the late 1980s, the visiting foreigners taught the villagers to extract the intoxicating resin from cannabis. Though successive governments have tried to wean the villagers away from narcotic trade, there is no other cash crop to rival cannabis in Malana. The maize and potatoes grown by the villagers do not fetch handsome returns."
"Investigators have released pictures showing how close an Air Canada flight came to crashing onto four planes at a US airport last month. Its pilots mistakenly descended towards a taxiway, where four planes were parked, instead of the runway before aborting the landing. Investigators said the incident came within a few feet of becoming one of the worst aviation disasters.","Newly released data and photos show how shockingly low an Air Canada jet was when it pulled up to avoid crashing into planes waiting on a San Francisco international airport taxiway last month. The Air Canada pilots mistook the taxiway for the runway next to it and flew their jet to just 59ft (18m) above ground before pulling up to attempt another landing, according to National Transportation Safety Board information released on Wednesday.That?s barely taller than the four planes that were on the taxiway when the incident occurred late at night on 7 July. Pilots in a United plane alerted air traffic controllers about the off-course jet, while the crew of a Philippine Airlines jet behind it switched on their plane?s landing lights in an apparent last-ditch danger signal to Air Canada. NTSB investigators said they have not determined probable cause for the incident that came within a few feet of becoming one of the worst disasters in aviation history.?It was close, much too close,? said John Cox, a safety consultant and retired airline pilot.The investigators said that as the Air Canada jet approached the taxiway just before midnight after a flight from Toronto, it was so far off course that it did not appear on a radar system used to prevent runway collisions.Those systems were not designed to spot planes that are lined up to land on a taxiway a rare occurrence, especially for airline pilots. But the Federal Aviation Administration is working on modifications so they can, agency spokesman Ian Gregor said.Both pilots of the Air Canada Airbus A320 jet were very experienced. The captain, who was flying the plane, had more than 20,000 hours of flying time, and the co-pilot had about 10,000 hours.The pilots told investigators ?that they did not recall seeing aircraft on taxiway but that something did not look right to them,? the NTSB said.Investigators could not hear what the Air Canada captain and co-pilot said to each other during the aborted landing because their conversation was recorded over when the plane made other flights, starting with a San Francisco-to-Montreal trip the next morning. Recorders are required to capture only the last two hours of a plane?s flying time.Peter Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for Air Canada, declined to comment, citing the investigation. "

The village is not far from the border with Maharashtra.The baby is admitted to a hospital and will be handed over to the district child welfare committee (CWC), officials said.Despite stringent rape laws, people in rural areas rarely report sexual assaults to police because of the stigma attached. Activists say people also blame the character of the victim, which puts more pressure on families to hide such incidents.Barwani superindent of police, Prashant Khare, said the girl?s family hurriedly married her off to a minor boy after discovering her pregnancy. She said she was raped about a year ago.But her husband, who came to know about the incident, also refused to accept the baby and told her to abandon it, the officer added.Khare said the ?painstaking investigation? took around 20 days.?It was a shock for us when we saw that the mother was a minor, her husband too was a minor as was the rapist,? he added.The girl hails from a village of Barwani and lives with with her husband in Sirpur, Maharashtra.

"Gujarat MLAs Mansingh Chouhan and Chhanabhai Chaudhary have quit Congress to join BJP on Friday, a day after three other MLAs had quit the party and joined BJP. The resignations come days after senior Congress leader Shankersinh Vaghela was sacked from the party. Notably, Gujarat Assembly elections for the 182-member House will be held by the end of this year.","A day after three Congress MLAs resigned from the party and joined the BJP in a huff in poll-bound Gujarat, two more legislators switched sides and joined the saffron party today. Vasda MLA Chhana Chaudhry and Balasinor's Mansinh Chauhan are the latest Congress leaders to join BJP. They have submitted their resignations to Speaker Ramanlal Vora. Chaudhary and Chauhan are believed to be close to rebel leader and former Chief Minister Shankersinh Vaghela, who quit as Leader of Opposition on his birthday on July 21, alleging that there was an intra-party conspiracy to oust him from the Congress.On Thursday, Balwantsinh Rajput, MLA from Siddhpur and Chief Whip of the Congress, Tejashree Patel from Viramgam, and Vijapur legislator PI Patel had submitted their resignations to the Speaker and later went to the BJP headquarters, Kamalam, to join the party. Within minutes of joining the BJP, Balwantsinh Rajput was named the third Rajya Sabha candidate of the BJP, besides national president Amit Shah and Union Minister Smriti Irani. Rajput was already rumoured to be planning to contest the Rajya Sabha election against official party nominee Ahmed Patel, the political secretary to Congress President Sonia Gandhi. Balwantsinh Rajput's daughter is married to Vaghela's son Mahendrasinh, also an MLA.Tejashree Patel and PI Patel asserted that the Congress had failed to take a position on the demand of the Patidars (Patels) for reservation to the community in government jobs and educational institutions. ""I have resigned from the Congress with a very heavy heart. I have worked for the party for 25 long years,"" Tejashree Patel, a firebrand woman leader and one of the most active legislators of the Congress in the state Assembly, bemoaned. ""From top to bottom, there is intra-party politicking in the Congress. The party never took a clear position on the aspirations of the Patidars,"" she said.

Balwantsinh Rajput echoed Tejashree Patel and said, ""Modi is Vikas Purush."" Rajput and PI Patel are from the North Gujarat constituency of Vijapur. Vaghela hails from North Gujarat too."
"The Delhi High Court on Tuesday declined AAP's request to use paper trail EVMs for the upcoming civic polls in Delhi. ""We cannot stay the election nor pass an order to use electronic voting machines which are not there,"" it added. The state election commission earlier said it was not possible to replace all the EVMs in four days.","The Delhi high court on Tuesday declined Aam Aadmi Party?s request to use second-generation EVMs with paper trail in the April 23 civic polls in the national capital.Justice AK Pathak refused immediate relief to the ruling party, saying that ?nothing can be done at the eleventh hour?. ?We cannot stay the election nor pass an order to use electronic voting machines which are not there,? the court said while seeking a response from the Election Commission of India and the Delhi State Election Commission by Friday, the next date of hearing.The AAP and its candidate Mohammad Tahir Hussain have approached the high court for using second-generation EVMs attached with Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) in the elections to the capital?s three municipal corporations.The court?s order came after State Election Commission counsel Sumeet Pushkarna opposed the plea on the ground that the MCD elections are slated for April 23 and changing all EVMs with VVPAT is not feasible in four days.The counsel said the EVMs to be used in the civic polls are the same that were used in 2015 assembly elections, after which the AAP came to power. ?But now they have speculation that these machines are tampered with. There are three judgements that elections at this stage cannot be stalled,? he added.Senior advocate Indira Jaising, appearing for the AAP and Hussain, contended that the poll panel was duty-bound to use the VVPAT-linked EVMs, adding that the Supreme Court in 2013 termed the second-generation EVMs as the ?safest?.Jaising said the EVMs compatible with VVPATs were used in Uttar Pradesh and Goa polls and the Election Commission of India has 13,000, apart from additional 3,000, second-generation EVMs with them.Raising concern over the EVM security, Jaising said: ?There is a demonstrable problem in Dholpur in Rajasthan -- no matter what button you press, the vote will go to the BJP.?The VVPAT is connected with EVMs and dispenses paper proof so that voters can verify that their vote has been cast correctly. The AAP and the Congress say that the EVMs without VVPAT can be tampered with. "

"UK roadside repair firm AA on Tuesday lost over £200 million (nearly ?1,690 crore) or nearly a fifth of its value. This came after shares fell as much as 18% during the day after it fired its Executive Chairman Bob Mackenzie with immediate effect for 'gross misconduct'. However, his son said he resigned over an 'extremely distressing mental health issue'. ","The AA has fired its boss, Bob Mackenzie, for ?gross misconduct?, with immediate effect, wiping nearly a fifth off the value of the company and making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 250.?Bob Mackenzie has been removed by the board from his role as executive chairman, from his other roles and as a director and as an employee of the company, for gross misconduct,? the AA said.A spokesperson for the roadside repair company said the sacking was a ?personal conduct related matter?, but gave no further details. It is not believed to involve fraud.However, a statement attributed by the Times to Mackenzie?s son, Peter Mackenzie, said his father had a serious health issue and had resigned. The statement said his father had tendered his resignation and resigned his directorships due to acute ill health. ?He is very unwell and has been admitted to hospital,? it said. ?The family trusts that all parties will act responsibly towards a loyal servant of the company in a manner which reflects the stress he has been suffering.?The company declined to comment beyond its initial statement.The shock announcement sent shares down as much as 18% at one point. The shares closed down 14%, wiping about £200m off the value of the company.Mackenzie, 65, has been executive chairman of the AA since 2014, when he was instrumental in a stock market flotation of the company. His previous roles include chairman and chief executive of National Car Parks and its subsidiary Green Flag, a rival car breakdown business.The AA said Mackenzie?s responsibilities would be split, with Simon Breakwell, a non-executive director since 2014 and a founder of the travel company Expedia, appointed as acting chief executive. John Leach, who was senior independent director, has been appointed as chairman.The company had already announced plans to split the combined roles of executive chairman, with the aim of appointing a chief executive.In a trading update published alongside the announcement of Mackenzie?s departure, the AA said it was confident about the company?s long-term prospects but its financial performance in the first half of 2017 had been hit by a number of factors.?The financial performance in the first six months has been negatively impacted by the effect of erratic work load patterns on an inherently fixed cost base. This was especially true in June and July which saw significant spikes in demand.?We now expect the full-year performance to be broadly in line with that of the last financial year.?The AA said paid members totalled 3.33 million in the first six months of the year, an increase of 6,000 compared with the same period a year earlier. The company would publish first-half results on 26 September. ?At that stage, Simon Breakwell will be in a position to provide an update on our plans,? the company said.Analysts at Liberum noted their surprise at Mackenzie?s departure, adding that they ?do not believe that it is fraud-related?.They revised down their expectations for full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation by 3% to £403m, but said the company had made progress in some areas. ?After the accelerated [stock market listing] in July 2014, management had acquired a strategic asset akin to a desirable residence in Mayfair, where the plumbing and electrics were in need of investment,? the Liberum analysts said. ?We now believe that the face-lift is largely complete.?Some of the key metrics are generally encouraging, although that may be lost today. The transformation may have taken longer but there is tangible evidence of improvement.?The AA said that existing board member Andrew Blowers would replace John Leach as senior independent director, while Martin Clarke continues as finance director."
The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is set to get its first 'driverless' trains on tracks between Noida and Kalkaji in June this year. These trains will run only on two metro lines ? Pink (Mukundpur-Shiv Vihar) and Magenta (Botanical Garden-Janakpuri West) ? and cannot be integrated with the other existing lines. Trials on these lines started last year.,"Come June and you will be able to travel on the swanky new trains of the Delhi metro, which can also run without drivers. Passengers travelling between Noida and Kalkaji are likely to be the first one to experience the travel with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) scheduled to complete the work on this section of phase-III in May.It will then apply for inspection, which usually takes a month, which means the line can be opened for public by June.The new trains will run on two new lines - Pink (Mukundpur-Shiv Vihar) and Magenta (Botanical Garden-Janakpuri west) and will cover a distance of 96 km. Delhi metro has also ordered 516 coaches (86 trains). These trains will run only on these two lines and cannot be integrated with the other existing lines. These trains have many unique features, which sets it apart from existing trains.Trials between Botanical Garden in Noida and Kalkaji Mandir (13 kilometres) in Delhi had started on October 27 last year while trial runs between Terminal 1-IGI airport and Janakpuri west (10KM) began on December 21. Track laying is nearing completion in the remaining underground section between Terminal 1 ? IGI Airport and Kalkaji Mandir and trials will be started on this section also in the coming months.?Since the signalling system and trains are new, we need at least six months of trial run. The mandatory tenure is completed for the Botanical Garden-Kalkaji section and after opening the Heritage Line (ITO-Kashmere Gate), we will start the process for this section,? said a DMRC official.The new trains, with extremely high levels of automation, had to undergo rigorous trials between these stations to ensure that they are ready for smooth operations after the commissioning of the corridor. Initially, train operators will run the trains, but gradually, driverless operations (on the Unattended Train Operation or UTO mode) will be possible.During the trial runs, the interface of the metro train was checked to ensure that there was no physical infringement with civil infrastructure and the various subsystems of coaches were also tested.Later on, in stages, the new signalling technology was implemented on this corridor; the Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) had to undergo rigorous testing. The response of the train at different speeds, braking and the interconnection with the Operations Control Centre (OCC) was also monitored during the trials. The behaviour of the track system and the Over Head Electrification (OHE) was checked repeatedly.This particular section from Botanical Garden till Kalkaji Mandir consists of nine elevated stations ? Botanical Garden, Okhla Bird sanctuary, Kalindi Kunj, Jasola Vihar Shaheen Bagh, Okhla Vihar, Jamia Milia Islamia, Sukhdev Vihar, Okhla NSIC and Kalkaji Mandir.

He was supposed to have been deported from Germany, but authorities said they could not get the right papers from Tunisia.Tunisian authorities say the reason it took so long to issue Amri?s papers is that they needed to carry out so many identity checks. Amri reportedly used at least six different names and three different nationalities in his travels around Europe.Updated

Stephanie KirchgaessnerAmri?s killing is an international story, but it is also comes at a critical time in Italy?s domestic politics. Paolo Gentiloni has been prime minister for nine days and had been consumed by a bank bailout of Monte dei Paschi di Siena just an hour before the shooting.It did not take long for the issue to become a source of political controversy. Beppe Grillo, the head of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, joined Marine Le Pen, of France, Geert Wilders, of the Netherlands, and Nigel Farage, of Ukip, in using the incident to criticise Europe?s open border policy under Schengen, which he said needed to be ?reviewed?. He said:It?s crazy that two ordinary officers should be put at risk and finding themselves having to deal with a terrorist wanted by half of Europe.The problem was the the result of a migrant crisis that was ?out of control?, said Grillo.The Five Star Movement has described itself as post-ideological, and neither left nor right in its political leanings. But Grillo?s response and evocation of the migrant crisis was in line with other rightwing leaders in Europe. Updated

""So, I don't find a need for union in this industry,"" he stated. He further noted, ""Even if there's a union, I don't think it will impact the industry much.""","Hyderabad, May 30 (PTI) Employees unions are not needed in information technology industry where work ethic is good and the staff are well-paid with techies even finding opportunities outside the company they work for, says a senior industry figure. Whenever there is a downturn, there is always noise about unions coming into play in the IT industry but it never sustained, ex-Chief Financial Officer of Infosys Ltd, V Balakrishnan told PTI. ""Work ethic is very good and salaries are high. Even today the attrition rate in the IT industry is double digit. It (talk of employees unions) always fizzles out after some point of time. It never sustained,"" he told PTI. ""But I think even if there is a union, I dont think it will impact the industry much because IT industry is one of the best paymasters in the country and second, the people find opportunities outside"", he said.

""IT industry is not bad, IT industry people are well taken care of, well-paid, and they find opportunities.

"Japan-based scientists have created a highly flexible material, five times tougher than carbon steel, by combining hydrogels with glass fibre. The reinforced hydrogel contains 40% water and is environment-friendly. The flexible material could be used in manufacturing, fashion, and even making artificial human body joints, which are subject to strong load-bearing tensions, researchers said.","Tokyo, Feb 27 (PTI) Scientists have created a highly flexible material that is tougher than steel, by combining hydrogels with woven glass fibre fabric, which may have a wide range of potential applications. Efforts are currently underway around the world to create materials that are friendly to both society and the environment. Among them are those that comprise different materials, which exhibit the merits of each component. Researchers from Hokkaido University in Japan focused on creating a reinforced material using hydrogels. Though such a substance has potential as a structural biomaterial, up until now no material reliable and strong enough for long-term use has been produced. To address the problem, the team combined hydrogels containing high levels of water with glass fibre fabric to create bendable, yet tough materials, employing the same method used to produce reinforced plastics. Researchers found that a combination of polyampholyte (PA) gels, a type of hydrogel they developed earlier, and glass fibre fabric with a single fibre measuring around 10 micrometres in diameter produced a strong, tensile material. The procedure to make the material is simply to immerse the fabric in PA precursor solutions for polymerisation. When used alone, the fibre-reinforced hydrogels developed by the team are 25 times tougher than glass fibre fabric, and 100 times tougher than hydrogels - in terms of the energy required to destroy them. Combining these materials enables a synergistic toughening. The team theorises that toughness is increased by dynamic ionic bonds between the fibre and hydrogels, and within the hydrogels, as the fibres toughness increases in relation to that of the hydrogels. Consequently, the newly developed hydrogels are 5 times tougher compared to carbon steel. ""The fibre-reinforced hydrogels, with a 40 per cent water level, are environmentally friendly,"" said Jian Ping Gong, from Hokkaido University in Japan. "

"A family in Mumbai has planted around 5,500 saplings in Aarey Milk Colony over the last 17 years. The initiative was started by Vinay Athalye, in 2000. Over the years he planted about 3,500 saplings, which have now turned into a dense forest with 75 varieties of trees. After his death, his family has been continuing the initiative. ","For more than 17 years, a family of five from Goregaon (East) has been planting saplings across Aarey Milk Colony during the monsoon and caring for them till they become full-grown trees. They have so far planted 5,500 saplings. Last year, they started a butterfly garden near Aarey dairy, and it is already buzzing with 15-20 species of butterflies. There are 86 species in Aarey, according to researchers.Sandeep Athalye, 37, his wife Vardayeeni, their four-year-old son Malhar and mother Aarti have been carrying the baton passed onto them by his father Vinay, who passed away in 2015. ?It all started with my father in 2000. He began planting trees with support from a club of walkers. People joined the group and helped him. My father would tell me that nature has its startling beauty and presents us with many gifts. It is our duty to return the favour,? said Sandeep. The senior Athalye first planted 100 sapling at unit 16 in Aarey. They were protected by the walkers? club. Over the next 15 years, he planted more than 3,500 saplings at Panchavati, New Zealand hostel, VIP guest house, Gaondevi Road and MHADA Road. ?At Panchavati, my father planted about 550 saplings from 2004 onwards. We took care of them and today, it is a dense forest with 75 varieties of trees. The focus should not just be on planting trees. Trees should be taken care of for at least next three to four years. That is how you take care of your children too, don?t you?? said Sandeep.After his father?s death, Sandeep, his wife and his mother took up the initiative to plant 2,000 saplings in Aarey. The butterfly garden was their recent initiative. ?The garden has 700 trees now with 70 nectar plant species, including Jamaican spike, lemon, jathropha, pentas, exoras and many other species. These are mostly plants that will attract the butterflies and help with their life cycle,? he said, adding that his son Malhar has planted saplings all by himself and loves to be in the company of butterflies.Their efforts come at a time when Aarey is being besieged by several development projects. Apart from a car depot and stabling lines for a Metro line, three plots have been marked for Metro VII. The green lung faces threat as the state is considering to change the land use from no-development zone to green zone, to pave way for more constructions and lastly several encroachments that have been cropping in different parts of the 3,166 acres of land. Residents of Aarey lauded the family?s efforts. ?The saplings planted 17 years ago have borne fruits today and the area is home to one of the largest biodiversity sites at Aarey,? said Biju Augustine, an Aarey resident. ?While the Panchvati land is now under Force 1 Security Services, the area is a forest thanks to the Athalyes. We need more people like them to protect the last green lungs of the city.?Over the years, the Athalyes were joined by many nature lovers and NGOs. ?Initially, we bought our own saplings and planted them, but after a while we began receiving donations and saplings from different groups that joined us on weekends,? said Sandeep adding, ?We never wanted publicity. The moment you seek publicity, the cause is bound to get buried.? The Athalyes plan to continue their efforts to conserve it. ?Aarey?s biodiversity is magical. The next generation needs to realise its value and why it?s necessary to double the number of plantations for every project. Development cannot come at the cost of the environment,? he said."

Many patients had no idea initially and kept standing in the queue,? said Sanjana Rawat, a nurse at LHMC.There are 38 hospitals under the Delhi government. Resident doctors in hospitals under the central government, except the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, were also part of the protest. Delhi government hospitals every day witness nearly 1,600 pre-scheduled surgeries and over 200 emergency ones.Patients in several other government hospitals such as Lal Bahadur Sastri Hospital, Dadadev Mother and Child Hospital and GB Pant were affected as only the emergency departments were functional and even the normal medicine OPD remained partially operational.?Nearly 60 per cent of patients at Dadadev Mother and Child hospital could not get doctors consultation or treatment due to the protest.

Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA) -- under whose banner the protest was being held in Delhi -- said of the 5,400 OPD cards registered in Delhi government hospitals on Thursday only 25 per cent of patients could consult doctors. The resident doctors have also threatened to go on a pan India strike soon if the government fails to ensure them a safe atmosphere to perform their duties. ?This mass casual leave was just an indication of what we can do to ensure our safety. If the health ministry does not take necessary steps to stop assault on doctors we will go on pan India strike,? said Pankaj Solanki, President FORDA, told IANS.Several private hospitals also came out in support of the protest by resident doctors.Sir Ganga Ram Hospital chairman DS Rana said that in solidarity with the ?concerns of safety of doctors? the general and private OPDs of the hospital will not function on Friday. The inpatient as well as emergency services will function normally.City-based Fortis condemned the rising cases of assault on doctors, but added the hospital will continue to function normally.?A safe and secure work environment is the basic requirement for care givers to provide best possible medical care to patients.

"A Chattisgarh woman was allegedly duped of ?3 lakh by her married lover and his wife. Her lover allegedly said he wanted to leave his ""estranged"" wife for her. She was asked to pay his wife ?6 lakh to marry him and managed to pay ?3 lakh before his wife told her to leave them alone as they were happy. ","A woman who was attempting to free her lover from his ""estranged"" wife discovered that the couple had created an elaborate plot to dupe her.The victim, who wanted to marry the man, was asked to pay Rs 6 lakh to the wife as a pre-condition to proceed. After shelling out Rs 3 lakh, when she sought more time to arrange the rest, the couple asked her to let them live in peace.The police have registered an FIR against the duo for rape and criminal intimidation.WHAT HAPPENEDThe 29-year-old victim is based in Chattisgarh and runs an apparel store. She met accused Ajay Gupta through an online portal where she had posted her number to promote her business. They started talking and grew close.The woman, who had just entered into the apparel business, decided to come to Delhi for purchases on the suggestion of the accused. She alleged that Ajay had sex with her after putting sindoor (vermilion) on her forehead and told her that he will apply for court marriage.However, after returning to Chattisgarh she learnt that Ajay was married and had two kids. ""Ajay told me that he was fed up with his marriage and wanted to marry me. I tried consoling him and said that he can take a decision and let me know. A while later, I received a call from his alleged estranged wife Uma Gupta who said that even she was fed up with her husband and had no problem with the two of us getting married,"" the victim told Mail Today.She was asked to pay Rs 6 lakh to the wife first, only after which the marriage could take place.""I agreed to this condition. I thought it was my moral responsibility to compensate the woman as she had two kids to take care of. I was in touch with both of them. They used to send me voice notes on messaging apps where I could hear them screaming their hearts out at each other. I was convinced that the two did not want to live together,"" the woman said.The victim claims that she encashed all her investments and paid Uma on her visits to Delhi. ""In the meanwhile, Ajay continued to meet me and maintain physical relations on the promise of marriage,"" she said.Things got ugly after she told the couple that she had run out of money and would need more time to arrange the cash. ""I asked Ajay to come to meet my family and decide the date for marriage and in the meantime I would arrange the money,"" the woman said. ""When he heard this, he started ignoring me. His wife called and pressurised me to arrange the cash if I wanted to marry Ajay.""Speaking to Mail Today, the victim said that she had already decided to sell her store and give all the earnings to Uma because after the marriage there would have been no one to run it.

"Microsoft has announced its long-standing basic graphics editing program 'MS Paint' will no longer be available with the next Windows 10 update called the Autumn Creators Update. The program was first released with the very first version of Windows 1.0 in 1985. MS Paint's removal is a part of Microsoft's plan to shut programs that are ""not in active development.""","Microsoft?s next Windows 10 update, called the Autumn (or Fall in the US) Creators Update, will bring a variety of new features. But one long-standing stalwart of the Windows experience has been put on the chopping block: Microsoft Paint.First released with the very first version of Windows 1.0 in 1985, Paint in its various guises would be one of the first graphics editors used by many and became a core part of Windows. Starting life as a 1-bit monochrome licensed version of ZSoft?s PC Paintbrush, it wasn?t until Windows 98 that Paint could save in JPEG.With the Windows 10 Creators Update, released in April, Microsoft introduced the new Paint 3D, which is installed alongside traditional Paint and features 3D image making tools as well as some basic 2D image editing. But it is not an update to original Paint and doesn?t behave like it.Now Microsoft has announced that, alongside Outlook Express, Reader app and Reading list, Microsoft Paint has been signalled for death having been added to the ?features that are removed or deprecated in Windows 10 Fall Creators Update? list.Falling under the deprecated column for apps that are ?not in active development and might be removed in future releases?, Microsoft Paint?s ticket has been called and now it?s only a matter of time before it is removed like your favourite piece of old furniture from your childhood home.Paint was never one of the most capable apps, and was limited to the bitmap (BMP) and PCX formats until 1998, but if you wanted to scribble something out using your mouse or make a quick cut and paste job, Paint was always there, even on work computers.The most recent version of Paint for Windows 7 and later was much improved, but still considered feature poor compared to other free alternatives such as the third-party Paint.NET.When Microsoft Paint will officially be removed from Windows has yet to be confirmed, while a precise date for the release of the Windows 10 Autumn Creators Update is equally up in the air. Whether, like Clippy, Windows users will celebrate or decry Paint?s removal, it will be a moment in the history of Windows as one of its longest-standing apps is put out to pasture."

"Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has advised the Indian cricket team to not drop catches or else current Australian captain Steve Smith will score a century. Clarke, who recently had a dinner with Indian captain Virat Kohli, called him a strong character and said, ""He is ready and focused on the Bengaluru Test"".","Question: Do you think Bhuvneshwar Kumar will replace Ishant Sharma in Bengaluru? Clarke: I think Ishant Sharma deserves to be in the team. Bhuvneshwar Kumar is a great player. He has great record against the left-handers, especially against Warner. India would want to get him in the squad. But I think Ishant surely deserves a place. CLICK TO WATCH FULL INTERVIEWQuestion: If it is a good pitch in Bengaluru, which team will have the advantage?Clarke: It is a first innings game... it is very critical to make as many runs in the first innings. Doesn't really matter if you win or lose the toss. You have to get a good score in the first innings. It sets the tone up. We have seen that now in a tough wicket in Pune. Test match is literally over in the first innings. It will be no different in Bengaluru. The wicket will deteriorate over the five days. So, on a good wicket, toss doesn't matter. You just want to score more runs in the first innings. Question: How would you get Steve Smith out?Clarke: Laughs... Smith is in unbelievable form... a lot like Virat Kohli. Some times you have to just watch and applaud when a player is in such terrific form. I think India had a lot of opportunities to get him out in Pune. There's now doubt India will have plans for each Australian batsmen. My advice to India would be to hand on to your catches. #AskMichael what advice you give to team india when they are using DRS system in test match where you have only 2 reviews for 80 overs#AskMichael Do you think India should open with Vijay and Pujara and send KL Rahul to bat at No. 3 with Kohli coming in at No. 3??NO CHANGES FOR AUSTRALIA:Clarke: I don't think Australia will make any change in Bengaluru. They have won the first Test and have the momentum. I think they will go with the same team in Bengaluru. On Ajinkya Rahane: Clarke: I think Rahane is a wonderful player... think India will give him another opportunity. I think India will make a change in Bengaluru. They will go with two spinner - R Ashwin and R Jadeja. I like to see Rahane in the team. If he is good form, that puts India in dominant position. Boria Majumdar: You had dinner with Virat Kohli last night. Give us some insights about his mind.Clarke: Virat Kohli is a strong character. He is ready and focused on the Bengaluru Test. I consider Kohli as the best batsman right now in all formats. Question: What India need to do to win in Bengaluru?Clarke: India need to combat the big four players in Bengaluru. David Warner, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood. If India can keep these four quiet in Bengaluru, they can win the Test match.  Michael Clarke: Positive for Australian cricket that they have won the first Test. But they know what challenge lies ahead. I am very impressive with what Virat Kohli said after the Pune loss.Australia now are confident that they can beat India at their own backyard.

After the awards were announced, numerous Twitter users questioned why the best actor National Award was given to Akshay Kumar and not Aamir Khan. Meanwhile, filmmaker Hansal Mehta also expressed disappointment at his film 'Aligarh' not receiving any recognition.","This year, award shows have come under the scanner. After the Filmfare Awards got flak for not nominating Akshay Kumar (Airlift) or Manoj Bajpayee (Aligarh) in the Best Actor category, the National Awards are being slammed for their decisions.

""Can clearly witness the influence & partiality of people in jury, it's biased,"" he wrote.#NationalAwardsCan clearly witness the influence & partiality of people in jury, it's biased.The decision to give Akshay Kumar the Best Actor for Rustom over other contenders like Aamir Khan (Dangal) and Manoj Bajpayee (Aligarh) has been questioned, with many alleging that the jury headed by Priyadarshan was biased. That the filmmaker is close to Akshay is common knowledge, and many claim that he abused his position as the head of the jury to favour the actor, who he directed in several films like Hera Pheri and Bhool Bhulaiyya.However, Priyadarshan defended the decision and told Indian Express, ""Why are we insulting an actor? If he was a bad actor, how is he one of the top stars of the film industry for so many years? 38 people decided to award him and these people are sensible. Does that mean they are fools? Also, last year Mr Amitabh Bachchan got the best actor trophy (for Piku) and Ramesh Sippy was on the jury, no one questioned that. When Ajay Devgn won for Gangaajal, Prakash Jha was on the jury. That time also no one said anything.""Other than Murugadoss, Aligarh director Hansal Mehta too expressed his disappointment over the list of winners. However, he clarified that the disappointment wasn't directed at anyone. He wrote on Twitter, ""When I expressed my disappointment about the National Awards it was personal and not directed at anybody. I would like to believe that the jury has done its best within their understanding and framework. Aligarh was not considered worthy in that framework by the appointed juries just like Lunchbox was ignored in the year that Shahid won two national awards. I did not complain then and I am not complaining now either. I've got to respect the decision and move on.""He added, ""What hurts is that in some statement the chairperson who I respect and whose films I've often enjoyed says that 'While watching films we realised that a lot of Bollywood movies were themed around homosexuality. The mnovies are not really highlighting social problems. Whereas regional cinema are themed around fantastic social issues.' This statement is disturbing and sensitive. Priyadarshan sir, Aligarh did not meet the standards set by you and your jury - I accept that.

We have decided to buy some more counting machines,? sources quoted him as saying.The bank had cut staff holidays and they were working ?round the clock? except on Sundays to count the notes.Some panel members, including Biju Janata Dal?s Bhartruhari Mahtab, Samajwadi Party?s Naresh Agarwal, flagged concern over the recent farmer agitation in Madhya Pradesh and other states, saying the farm distress was reportedly linked to the unavailability of cash in rural India following demonetisation. Trinamool?s Saugata Ray alleged ?even now, rural bank branches are giving only Rs 1,000 if a farmer asks for Rs 5,000?, sources said.The RBI would give more cash to busy rural branches, Patel said.There was a 50-day window -- from November 9 to December 30 -- for the exchange of old notes at banks and post offices. After December 30, designated offices of the RBI accepted the scrapped currency till June 30.Indians who were abroad during the 50-day period were given a three-month grace period, till March 31, to deposit the old notes. In the case of NRIs, the deadline was June 30.Responding to a clutch of petitions, the Supreme Court on July 4 asked the government and the RBI to consider granting a window to those who couldn?t exchange old notes for ?genuine reasons?."

"Upset over frivolous petitions being filed in the Supreme Court, Chief Justice JS Khehar on Friday imposed a fine of ?10 lakh on a Bihar MLA and ?1 lakh on a Maharashtra professor. ""Look at my white beard. After reading all this I feel tired also. So please,"" he said. Notably, SC has a backlog of over 61,000 cases.","""Whatever the case, we have to read all these pages. My brother judges are young (looking at justices DY Chandrachud and NV Ramana seated with him). They have no problem going through the entire records but I am old. Look at my white beard. After reading all this I feel tired also. So please,"" 65-year-old Chief Justice of India JS Khehar said in the Supreme Court on Friday. The CJI was both upset and angry about the number of frivolous petitions piling up in the apex court, which is already reeling under a backlog of nearly 61,000 cases.Pointing out that he has started imposing heavy costs on such petitioners, he slapped fines of Rs 10 lakh on a Bihar MLA and Rs 1 lakh on a Maharashtra professor in two separate cases.The CJI's remarks came just before the lawyer for the professor said she wanted to withdraw the case, which was filed challenging a circular issued by the Gujarat government. An angry Khehar rebuked the lawyer and allowed her to withdraw the plea but after imposing a Rs 1 lakh fine.BACKLOG""Why do you now want to go back to Gujarat? Why did not this occur to you when you were preparing the petition?"" he said.When the lawyer pleaded for cancelling the cost, CJI Khehar shot back: ""No. This has to stop and only this way it can stop. For years we have not done it. See if you have a good cause we are with you but not for such petitions which take away judicial time.""Millions of cases are pending in India's courts, draining litigants of resources and pointing towards an urgent need for more judges and judicial reforms. Khehar's predecessor, TS Thakur, said last year that the country needs to double the number of judges.The CJI imposed a Rs 10 lakh fine on Bihar MLA Ravindra Singh for indulging in frivolous litigation. The legislator from the state's ruling RJD had challenged in the SC a high court order dismissing his petition, which questioned the veracity of a 23-year old newspaper article. SC said the cost needs to be higher as the representative of the people was found indulging in ""unpardonable"" activity of wasting judicial time. When the MLA's lawyer pleaded that the cost be reduced, the CJI said after hearing the plea for leniency what came to his mind was the story of a hostel mate while he was a college student.ADJOURNMENTSRecounting the incident, the CJI said, ""When a fine of Rs 25 was imposed on him in a case of indiscipline, he had said, 'I belong to a rich family. At least impose a fine of Rs 250.' Likewise you also please say I am an MLA, please impose a fine of Rs 1 crore on me and not mere Rs 10 lakh. Come on,"" the CJI told the MLA's lawyer, raising peals of laughter in the packed courtroom.What apparently set the tone for the CJI's angry mood in the morning hours itself was a petition filed by a car mechanic from Madurai. He was challenging ""illegal additional floors"" in a hospital in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu.""Can a car mechanic complain about a hospital? What has he got to do with it? All these are vested interests. If anybody has a good cause we are there to hear it. We are adjourning this matter and in the next hearing if you are not able to prove your bonafides, we will impose costs on you,"" he said.""How many cases we are going to hear which are nonsense and trash? Daily we are seeing such petitions increasing. This is Supreme Court. Do have some respect for us?,"" Khehar questioned.Within hours after taking charge on January 4, CJI Khehar had made his determination to bring down the backlog in the apex court clear by summarily dismissing long-pending frivolous petitions and refusing adjournments in cases. He had begun the practice of disposing of old petitions in a single sitting without granting any adjournments."

Luckily, the bullets did not hit the policemen. According to the police, the five men came to the Central Bank ATM around 2am in a Honda city car. They parked the car outside and went in.

"Researchers at the University of Central Florida have developed an anti-glare film that could allow people to read from their smartphones and tablets even in bright sunlight. The coating is inspired by the nanostructures that cover moth eyes and prevent light from reflecting off them. The flexible, self-cleaning coating increases readability by up to 10 times in different lighting conditions.","Washington, Jun 23 (PTI) Inspired by the nanostructures found on moth eyes, scientists have developed a new anti- reflection film that could allow people to read from their smartphones and tablets even in bright sunlight. The film exhibits a surface reflection of just 0.23 per cent, much lower than the iPhones surface reflection of 4.4 per cent, for example. Reflection is the major reason it is difficult to read a phone screen in bright sunlight, as the strong light reflecting off the screens surface washes out the display. ""Using our flexible anti-reflection film on smartphones and tablets will make the screen bright and sharp, even when viewed outside,"" said Shin-Tson Wu from the University of Central Florida in the US. ""In addition to exhibiting low reflection, our nature- inspired film is also scratch resistant and self-cleaning, which would protect touch screens from dust and fingerprints,"" said Wu, who led the study published in the journal Optica. The new film contains tiny uniform dimples, each about 100 nanometres in diameter (about one-thousandth of the width of a human hair). The coating can also be used with flexible display applications such as phones with screens that fold like a book, which are expected to hit the market as soon as next year. Many of todays smartphones use a sensor to detect bright ambient light and then boost the screens brightness level enough to overcome the strong surface reflection. Although this type of adaptive brightness control can help improve readability, it also drains battery power. Other methods for solving the sunlight visibility problem have proved difficult to implement. Looking for a simpler approach to improve screen readability outside, the researchers turned to nature. The eyes of moths are covered with a pattern of antireflective nanostructures that allow moths to see in the dark and prevent eye reflections that might be seen by predators. The researchers developed a fabrication technique that uses self-assembled nanospheres to form a precise template that can be used to create the moth-eye-like structure on a coating. "
